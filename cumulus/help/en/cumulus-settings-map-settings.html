	<h4 align="center">Settings - Maps</h4>

	<p>On this page you can set the maps storage location and the map
		basic data.</p>

	<dl>

		<a name="Maps">
			<dt>
				<b>Maps Location</b>
			</dt>
		</a>

		<dd>
			With the help of the button <i>Maps</i> you can open a directory selection
			dialog and define a new storage folder for the landscape maps.
			In the text field beside the button you can see the current
			selection. You can modify the text field also by hand and set so your
			preferred location.
		</dd>

		<br>
		<a name="Projection">
			<dt>
				<b>Projection</b>
			</dt>
		</a>

		<dd>
			The coordinate points of the raw maps Cumulus uses are not projected.
			They are coded according to WGS84 datum. Therefore all these points
			are projected on first loading. There are many types of map
			projections available. You need a projection because the earth is a
			sphere (or close to it) and your map is flat.

			<p>Cumulus supports two projections:</p>

			<ol>
				<li><i>Plate Carr&eacute;e</i> - Equidistant Cylindrical
					Projection</li>
				<li><i>Lambert</i> - Conical Orthomorphic Projection</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The first is computationally simpler and thus the preferred one in
				Cumulus. The latter is more complex, so your maps will take much
				longer on first load but it is more realistic. Each map projection
				needs a basis from where to work. <br>The <i>Plate
				Carr&eacute;e</i> projection needs a parallel close to the displayed
				map center. That ensures an unskewed map display. You are not
				forced to set this parallel by hand, Cumulus will do it automatically.
				<br><br>
				For	<i>Lambert</i> projection you should select the parallels so that
				they are covering the area you are flying. For example, you could
				choose the parallels from your official flying map. Then you will
				have an equal look like these maps. You should select the longitude
				from the middle of the area you are flying. It is needed because of
				some technical reasons not for the projection itself. No automatic
				update of projection data is done here. You must do that always by
				hand. Therefore use this kind of projection only, if you are
				familiar with the Lambert projection. <br> After changing the
				projection kind or the standard parallel values Cumulus is forced to
				recompile your map files.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Please note that:</b> If you don't set the projection options
				correctly, you will likely end up with a blue screen or a skewed
				map. This is especially so if you are far away from the coordinates
				used in the projection!
			</p>
		</dd>

		<br>
		<dt>
			<b>Unload unused maps from RAM</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>Cumulus supports two strategies for keeping maps in memory.
			Maps are only loaded if needed, but they can either stay there until
			they really need to be moved out of memory, or they can be removed
			sooner. The first strategy is more suited for users who want to zoom
			in and out a lot and have plenty of memory in their device, the
			latter strategy is the default one and to be recommended for people
			with lower memory devices.</dd>

		<br>
		<dt>
			<b>Center Latitude/Longitude</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>The coordinates of your center point around that map files
			  shall be downloaded from the Internet.</dd>

		<br>
		<dt>
			<b>Install Maps and Distance</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
			Define a distance in the spin box around your center point and press
			then the <i>Install Maps</i> button. Cumulus tries to download all
			map files from the KFLog Map Room, which lays around the center
			point. Ensure that an active Internet connection is available to that
			time. Otherwise all downloads do fail. If Cumulus is in move (faster
			as 5 Km/h) no downloads are executed. If all download requests are
			processed you will get once a result message. Cumulus does not record
			a special log file for that. If Cumulus is started in a X-Terminal
			window you can see the single results as debug messages.
