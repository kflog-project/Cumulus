	<h4 align="center">Cumulus Flight Settings - Checklist</h4>

	<b>Checklist</b>

	<p>
		Here you can define a checklist, which could help you during your
		flight preparation and that you don't forget important points. The
		checklist is located in the data directory of Cumulus and carry the
		name <i>cumulus-checklist.txt</i>. This file is a simple text file and can
		also be created outside of Cumulus, e.g on your PC. From the PC you
		can copy the file onto your PDA, maybe via USB. If you use special
		characters or	umlauts, please ensure, that they all are UTF-8 encoded.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The checklist menu page supports also the creation and modification of
	  checklist entries with the help of the right placed buttons.
	</p>

  <p>
    When the checklist is opened, you can see at the left side of every check
    entry a question mark icon. If you have finished the check at a line
    you can tip at the question mark icon to change it to an OK icon. So you
    can see, which checks have been passed successfully.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Note!</b> If the checklist is opened, all icons are set to question marks.
