	<h3 align="center">Flarm</h3>

	Cumulus can be connected to a Classic FLARM or to a PowerFlarm device
	and is able to process the proprietary sentences emitted by that
	devices. On the map display it shows the positions of the most important
	(collision-threatening) aircraft or ground obstacles, as well as all
	selected objects by you. Furthermore, as an alternative to the map view, a
	radar view display is provided showing all received Flarm contacts.

	<font color="#CC0000">
		<h4>Warning</h4> <b>Please note: Cumulus is not a replacement
			for Flarm, it is only an addition to it!</b>
	</font>

	<h4>Flarm connection</h4>

	Flarm devices only have a bidirectional serial RS232 interface. Cumulus
	can be connected to a Flarm device via this interface or by means of an
	RS232-USB gadget or an RS232-Bluetooth gadget.
	Which variant do you use depends on your available PDA hardware. The use
	of a USB connection requires the USB port to support the OTG (On-the-go)
	mode. See also in	<a href="cumulus-settings-gps.html">Settings - GPS</a>
	for	more informationen.

	<h4>Flarm configuration</h4>

	To get the specific Flarm data, you have to enable the NMEAOUT option
	in the FLARM setup menu. Activate the sending of GPRMC, GPGGA, GPGSA,
	PGRMZ plus the FLARM proprietary sentences. As transfer speed, you
	should select 57.6 kBaud. Cumulus sends no initialization data to
	Flarm, so you must set up the Flarm device by using an initialization
	file contained on a micro SD card (Classic FLARM) or on an USB stick (PowerFLRAM).
	<br><b>Note:</b> The Flarm device must be connected with the storage unit containing the
	initialization file before power-up.
	<br>
	An initialization file can be created by using the FLARM CONFIGURATION TOOL.
	Additional information you can find at the web page from
	<a href="https://flarm.com/de/support/tools-software/flarm-configuration-tool/">
	flarm.com</a>.

	<h4>Cumulus GPS settings</h4>

	In the
	<a href="cumulus-settings-gps.html">Settings - GPS</a> menu select a
	serial, bluetooth or USB device according to your available hardware
	and set the transfer speed to 57600. Futhermore, as
	<i>Altitude Reference</i> select the entry
	<i>Pressure</i>. This ensures that the data of the Flarm pressure
	sensor are used as altitude. Calibrate the altitude shown to the
	expected altitude by using the altitude dialog (Leveling). This can be
	opened by tapping on the altitude display in the map view.

  <h4>Flarm IGC data setup</h4>
  
  Cumulus can setup IGC parameters in the Flarm device and can upload a task
  to it. That all can be done on the
  <a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-flarm.html">
  Flight Settings - Flarm</a> page.
  
  <h4>Flarm IGC file download</h4>
  
  Cumulus can download IGC flight files from the Flarm device. To do that,
  open the <a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-logbooks.html">
  Flight Settings - Flight logbooks</a> page.
  
  <h4>Flarm traffic - information and alarms</h4>
  
  If Flarm issues a traffic message or an alarm, Cumulus opens a popup box with
  an arrow picture signaling the traffic movement direction and additionally
  some basic information is displayed.

	<h4>Flarm radar view</h4>

	You can open the Flarm radar view by tapping on the Track (Trk) display
	in the map view. The view consist of an inner and outer circle with a
	cross in the centre. The upper end of the vertical line points to 12
	o'clock (straight ahead as seen from the cockpit). In the upper left
	corner you can see the current selected display scale, while at the
	right side of the window you have, from top to bottom, the following
	operational buttons:

	<p></p>
	<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Scale:</b></td>
				<td>Pressing the zoom button toggles through three different
					scales (0.5, 1.0, 6.0 Km), displayed in the upper left corner.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><a href="#ListView"><b>List:</b></a></td>
				<td>Pressing the list button opens a new window with a list of
					all the just-received Flarm contacts.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Time:</b></td>
				<td>Pressing the time button toggles the refresh interval of
					the radar view through 1, 2 and 3 seconds. Default is 2 seconds.
					The refresh rate also has an influence on the processor load and
					the object selection.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><a href="#AliasList"><b>Aliases:</b></a></td>
				<td>Pressing the monkey button opens a new window with a table
					of your defined Flarm alias names.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Plus&nbsp;sign:</b></a></td>
				<td>The plus button is only to see, if you have selected a
					Flarm object. Pressing the plus button opens a dialog window where
					you can enter an alias name for the selected Flarm object. The
					entered name is added to the alias list, if you leave the dialog
					via the ok button. An existing entry will be updated with the new
					passed data.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Close:</b></td>
				<td>Pressing the cancel button (red with white X) returns to
					the map view.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</blockquote>

	In the radar view, Flarm objects are displayed with different shapes
	according to the information they contain:

	<p></p>
	<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Square:</b></td>
				<td>If no track information is available, the Flarm object is
					drawn as a square. The square is also used to indicate a ground
					obstacle contained in your Flarm's database.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Arrowhead:</b></td>
				<td>If track information is available, the Flarm object is
					drawn as an arrowhead pointing in the direction of movement.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</blockquote>

	Objects are drawn in different colours according to their assigned
	alarm level, or to indicate selection. The colours used are:

	<p></p>
	<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Black:</b></td>
				<td>The alarm level of the object is <i>low</i>. This includes
					both the "no alarm" and "low-level alarm" levels described in the
					Flarm Dataport Manual.
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Orange:</b></td>
				<td>The alarm level of the object is <i>important</i>. This
					means that there is less than 13 seconds to go to a predicted
					collision.
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Red:</b></td>
				<td>The alarm level of the object is <i>urgent</i>, i.e., less
					than 8 seconds to a predicted collision.
				</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Magenta:</b></td>
				<td>The object has been selected by the user. In this case the
					alarm level of the object is not considered.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		<b>Note!</b> The Flarm Operating Manual v4.06 uses different (English)
		terms for the above-mentioned alarm levels.
	</p>

	<p>If you tap on a Flarm object in the radar view, you will get
		additional information displayed, if available. The information, drawn
		in magenta, is as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Flarm identifier:</b></td>
				<td>The identifier of the selected Flarm object is displayed in
					the lower left corner as a 6-digit hex value. If an alias name has
					been defined for the Flarm identifier, this name replaces it.
					If FlarmNet data are available, the Flarm identifier can be replaced
					by the airplane registration, if it is contained in that data. But the
					alias name has the first priority in the replacement.
					</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Distance:</b></td>
				<td>The distance to the selected Flarm object is displayed in
					the lower right corner of the window.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Vertical separation and climb rate:</b></td>
				<td>The vertical separation and the climb rate of the selected
					Flarm object are displayed in the upper right corner of the window.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</blockquote>

	<h4>
		<a name="ListView"></a>Flarm list view
	</h4>

	Pressing the list button in the radar view opens a new window giving a
	list of all just-received Flarm contacts. The following information may
	be displayed:

	<p></p>
	<blockquote>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Flarm identifier:</b></td>
				<td>The identifier of the Flarm object as 6-digit hex value. If an
					alias name has been defined for the Flarm identifier, this name
					replaces it. If FlarmNet data are available, the Flarm identifier
					can be replaced by the airplane registration, if it is contained in
					that data. But the alias name has the first priority in the
					replacement.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Distance:</b></td>
				<td>The distance of the Flarm object from one's own position.</td>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td><b>Vertical separation:</b></td>
				<td>The vertical separation of the Flarm object above (positive
					value) or below (negative value) one's own position.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Relative bearing:</b></td>
				<td>The relative bearing to the Flarm object as an arrowhead.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Ground speed:</b></td>
				<td>The ground speed of the Flarm object.</td>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Rate of climb:</b></td>
				<td>The rate of climb of the Flarm object. Can be positive or
					negative.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
        <td><b>Competition sign:</b></td>
        <td>The competition sign is displayed, if FlarmNet data have been
            loaded and it is contained in them.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Frequency:</b></td>
        <td>The Frequency is displayed, if FlarmNet data have been
            loaded and it is contained in them.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Airplane type:</b></td>
        <td>The airplane type is displayed, if FlarmNet data have been
            loaded and it is contained in them.</td>
      </tr>
		</table>
	</blockquote>

	Any entry in the list can be selected by tapping on it. If you then
	press the
	<i>Select</i> button, the window is closed and you will return to the
	radar view. The additional data of your selected entry are now
	displayed there. A selection can be reset by pressing the
	<i>Unselect</i> button followed by the
	<i>Close</i> button.

	<h4>
		<a id="AliasList"></a>Flarm alias list
	</h4>

	Pressing the monkey button opens a new window giving a table view of
	your defined Flarm alias names. A 6-digit Flarm hex identifier can be
	replaced by a more easily-remembered name. The length of an alias name
	is limited to 15 characters. To add a new alias name, press the
	<i>Plus</i> button. This appends a new row with three columns at the end
	of the table. In the left column enter the Flarm identifier to be
	translated and in the right column beside your desired alias name.
	If you check the box at the right side, the contact is shown at the map,
	when it is received. An existing
	entry can be changed by clicking on the cell to be modified.
	<b>Note!</b> If you add the same Flarm identifier to the table more
	than once, only the last entry is saved. If you want to remove one or
	more entries, select them and press the
	<i>Trash-bin</i> button.

	<p>
		Leave the window with the <i>Ok</i> button to store the changes you
		made, or with the <i>Cancel</i> button to discard all changes.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you select a row in the table and leave the window with the <i>Ok</i>
		button, the selected Flarm object will become your new selection in
		the map and radar views. To make a deselection of a selected object in
		the radar view, go into the alias window, do not select anything and
		return via <i>Ok</i> to the radar view.
	</p>

	<h4>Flarm alias file</h4>

	The content of the Flarm alias table is stored in a file with the name
	<a href="cumulus-file-locations.html">cumulus-flarm.txt</a>. This file
	name is hard-coded and the file is stored in the user's
	<a href="cumulus-settings-personal.html#DataDirectory"> Data
		Directory</a>.

	<p>The file format of the Flarm alias list is very simple. A
		comment line starts with a hash mark or a dollar sign in the leftmost
		position and ends with a new line. A valid entry has the following
		format:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<b>&lt;Flarm-Id&gt; ';' &lt;Alias-Name&gt; ';' &lt;Map-display [0,1]&gt;</b>

		<p>
			<b>Example:</b>
		</p>
		<pre>
# Flarm alias file, comment line
$ another comment line
ABCDEF;My best friend;1
</pre>

	</blockquote>

	Note that no white spaces are allowed on either side of the semicolon!

	<h4>
		<a name="DataUpdate"></a>Flarm data up-to-dateness
	</h4>

	Flarm data age very fast, especially if the objects are circling. Flarm
	normally sends data every second about the objects in view. If a Flarm
	contact moves out of the receiver range, Cumulus will no longer get new
	data about it. To clean up such old collected data, all Flarm contacts
	that are not updated within three seconds are automatically removed.

	<p>In order to reduce the processor load, the data in the Flarm
		list views are only updated every three seconds.</p>
