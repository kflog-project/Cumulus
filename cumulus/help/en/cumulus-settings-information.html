	<h4 align="center">Settings - Information</h4>

	<p>In the spin boxes you can configure the display duration of the
		information windows. The information windows can appear automatically
		(warnings) or if you touch a symbol on the map. After given time is
		expired it will be removed automatically unless the time is set to
		zero. In this case the user must quit the window manually by hand
		touch.</p>

	<p>All times are defined in seconds. To make the display duration
		more sensitive with the amount of information to be displayed the real
		time is weighted with them. That means more items to display will
		extend the window stay time.</p>

	<p>With the item Warning suppress time you can suppress the same
		airspace warning for a certain time to be defined in minutes here.
		Multiple warnings are generated, if you move between the different
		warning distances, definable under the tabulator Airspace e.g. during
		circling. The value zero switches off the suppression.</p>

	<p>An audible alarm can be switched on/off. It is used to emphasize
		special situations like approaching near to airspaces. The general
		default is on.</p>
		
	<p>Flarm traffic information and alarms can be switched on/off here.
	   If switched on little popup windows will appear with the related
	   traffic information, if Cumulus is with a Flarm device connected.
	   The general default is on.</p>

	<p>The Nearst Site Calculator is computing the distances and the
		reachability to the nearst sites in flight. If this feature is
		unwanted, it can be switched off here to spare processing resources.</p>
    
   <P>If the black display is checked, waypoint and turnpoint data
      are shown on a black background with white writing, to make them better
      readable in sunshine. If the box not checked the display is reverse.</P>

	<p>
		The button <i>Reset to defaults</i> can be used to reset all done
		changes to the initial state. The settings here take immediate effect,
		if the OK button is pressed.
