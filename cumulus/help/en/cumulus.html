		Cumulus is a program designed for the soaring community. It provides a
		moving map display with all the information you need to make
		navigation easier while flying, yet requiring a minimum of user
		interaction. Navigation during flight is based on the processing of
		standard NMEA records delivered by a GPS receiver. Additionally, the
		proprietary NMEA sentences of some logger devices can be included in
		the processing.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Cumulus features a full colour moving map with information on
		terrain, point data, airspace, (rail-) roads, water, cities and many
		other details. It handles waypoints, IGC logging and tasks in
		cooperation with KFLog. Wind determination, reachable sites, final
		glide, sunrise and sunset calculations, retrieving of airport weather
		reports (METAR and TAF), live tracking of flights as well as automatic task
		point switching are also supported.
