	<h4 align="center">Flight Settings - Live Tracking</h4>

	 <p>
    At this page you define all the things for the <i>Live Tracking</i>.
   </p>
	
	 <p>
	  <i>Live Tracking</i> means using a GPS to determine your position and a
		mobile network to send this position in real-time to a server, that other
		people can see your exact position and track presented in a map just
		in time. The tracking option needs the capability to connect to mobile
		networking during flight with your used device.</p>
		  	
	<p>
	If you switch on the Live Tracking at this page, the sending of position data
	is started automatically, if a certain speed over ground is reached. The
	start speed is adjustable on this page at the menu point
	<a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-common.html#AutostartIgcLogger">
	Autostart IGC logger</a>. If you stand still for ca. 60s, the Live Tracking
	is finished and closed automatically. Per flight there exists only one active
	session. If all data of the previous session could not be transmitted to the
	server, they will be removed with the start of a new Live Tracking session.
	</p>

		connection is down for a longer time (ca. 1h) the oldest route
		package is removed from the cache during the entry of a new route
		package to prevent a memory overflow.
