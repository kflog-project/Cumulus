	<h3 align="center">Maps</h3>

	<p>Cumulus uses the following sets of maps:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Ground and Terrain Maps</b> with streets, highways,
			cities, rivers, lakes, ... and terrain data with elevation
			information. These cover the entire world. Cumulus is able to download all
			the map files that you need.
			See <a href="cumulus-settings-map-settings.html#Download">Map-Settings</a>
			for more information.
		</li>

		<br><li><b>Airspaces:</b> Cumulus supports the <i>OpenAir</i> and the
			<i>openAIP</i> file format for airspace structures. Further hints you
			can find <a href="cumulus-maps-airspaces.html">here</a>.
		</li>

	 <br><li><b>Point Data:</b> Source for airports, airfields, navaids,
		airport reporting points and thermal hotspots is the
	  <a href="cumulus-maps-openAIP.html">openAIP</a> project.
	 </li>
	</ul>

	<p>The maps are installed in different places depending on the used device:</p>
  <br>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <th>OS</th>
      <th>Map root directory</th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <th>Linux Desktop</th>
      <td>$HOME/Cumulus/maps</td>
    </tr>
        
    <tr>
      <th>Android</th>
      <td>/sdcard/Cumulus/maps (internal or external SD-card)</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
	  These are the default locations.
  </p>
    
	<p>
		<b>Please note! The map files have to be stored in different
			subdirectories under the root map path.</b>
	</p>

  <br>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="5">
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>
      <th>Map kind</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th>.../maps/landscape</th>
      <td>The ground and terrain data files</td>
    </tr>
  
    <tr>
      <th>.../maps/points</th>
      <td>POI data files like airfields, outlandings, navaids and hotspots</td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <th>.../maps/airspaces</th>
      <td>The airspace files</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

	<p>
		If you want to install the maps elsewhere than the known locations,
		you must give the path to the new map root directory on the
		<a href="cumulus-settings-map-settings.html#Maps">Map Settings</a>
		configuration page.
		Use the <a href="cumulus-settings-map-settings.html#Maps">Maps</a>
		button to navigate to the appropriate root directory under which the
		expected maps' subdirectories are to be found.
	</p>

  <p>
    <b>Note! Under Android you cannot change the map root directory.</b>
  </p>

	<p>Only load the point data and the airspace maps for the area you
		need. This will make Cumulus faster and save runtime memory. If you
		experience memory problems running Cumulus, you can choose not to
		install certain map sets. You could, for instance, skip the terrain
		maps. This will disable the display of terrain features (the isolines)
		but it will also save memory and reduce the time used for map loading
		and drawing. It is advisable to use at least the Ground maps because
		otherwise you will end up with a blue background, which is not very
		helpful for navigation.</p>

	<p>
		The maps you install are not projected. This work is done on loading.
		Because this is a computationally complex operation, the resulting
		maps are stored again with a
		<i>.kfc</i>, <i>.jsonc</i> or <i>.txc</i> extension. For many maps,
		these files are a bit smaller than the original files. The next time
		Cumulus needs to load the file, it first tries to load this
		<i>compiled</i> file to improve speed. In the
		<a href="cumulus-settings-map-settings.html"> Map Settings</a> page
		you can modify the behaviour of Cumulus for map projection and map
		compilation.
