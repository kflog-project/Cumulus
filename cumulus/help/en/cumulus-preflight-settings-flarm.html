	<h4 align="center">Flight Settings - Flarm-IGC</h4>

	<p>
		Here you have the possibility to readout and set several Flarm data. On this
		page you can upload a selected flight task together with its related data
		to the Flarm device, if it has an IGC license.
	</p>

	<h4>Window description</h4>

	In the upper window part are displayed different read only items in the
	<i>Flarm Data</i> panel from the Flarm device. The headline of the box is set
	to the Flarm device type. If the fields are filled with <i>???</i>
	no data could be read from the Flarm device. In this case there seems to be no
	active connection available. The abbreviated labels in the <i>Flarm Data</i>
	panel have the following meaning:

  <p>
  <table border="2" cellpadding=5>
  <tr> <td> <b>SN:</b> </td> <td> Serial number </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Radio Identifier:</b> </td> <td> ICAO/FLARM </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Sv:</b> </td> <td> Severity of issue </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Err:</b> </td> <td> Error code </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>FW:</b> </td> <td> Installed firmware version </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>FWEXP:</b> </td> <td> Expire date of firmware </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>Region:</b> </td> <td> The region in which the device can be used </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>IGC:</b></td> <td> IGC version. Empty on none approved IGC Flarms. </td> </tr>
  </table>
  </p>

  <p>
	<b>Note!</b> If Flarm reports a severity or an error code in the framed box
	beside the <i>Sv:</i> or <i>Err:</i> label, you can click on that framed box
	and you will get a textual description of the code.
  </p>
  
  <dl>
  
  <dt><b>LogInt</b></dt>

  <br><dt><b>Priv</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
  Here you can set/unset the so called <i>Stealth mode</i> of the
  Flarm device. 0 means off and 1 means on.
  <b>If you don't know, what it is, let it switched off (0)! That is better
  for your personal safety.</b>
  </dd>
  
  <br><dt><b>NoTrk</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
  Flarm <i>opt-out</i> option for ground tracking (“no track”). If set,
  the receiving ground stations should not process or store position data of
  your glider. 0 means off and 1 means on.
  </dd>
  
  <br><dt><b>H-Range</b></dt>
  
  <dd>
  Here you can set the horizontal distance of aircraft to be shown in meters.
  PowerFlarm supports the range 2000...65535m. All other Flarms 2000...25500m. 
  </dd>
  
  <br><dt><b>Pilot and glider data</b></dt>

  <dd>
  In different input boxes you can set the pilot and glider data, used in
  IGC data file logging. 
  </dd>
 
  <br><dt><b>Task</b></dt>
		<dd>
			In the displayed label at the right side of the task label you can
			see the currently activated task in Flarm, if you have a PowerFlarm.
			All other Flarms do not support that. <br> In the displayed
			combo box at the right side of the task label you can select a task
			to be flown. Preselected is the currently activated task in Cumulus.
			But you can change here the current task selection, if you want to do
			that. The new selected task will be considered as the task to be used
			for flying, if you upload it to the Flarm device. <br> A task
			can also be selected at the <a
				href="cumulus-preflight-settings-task.html">flight task page</a>.
			<br>
			<br> <b>Note:</b> A taskname and all waypoint names must be
			consist of pure visible ASCII signs out the code range 0...127. If
			the taskname contains other signs, e.g. umlauts, special national
			signs, etc., the task upload to Flarm will fail with an error
			message.
