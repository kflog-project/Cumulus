	<h3 align="center">Display</h3>

	The main, so-called map view of Cumulus consists of three information
	areas. These contain:

	<ol>
		<li>the flight information</li>
		<li>a map</li>
		<li>a status bar</li>
	</ol>

	In addition, a menu bar may be raised above the display. This gives
	access to various setup menus and other options.

	<h4>Flight information</h4>

	<p>The group of small windows on the left-hand side are (from top
		to bottom and left to right) as follows:</p>

	<ul>

		<li><b>To</b> - Selected target and, in parentheses, its
			elevation. Tap on display to select a target from the points lists.</li>

		<li><b>Arr</b> - Arrival Altitude above (positive) or below
			(negative) the selected target <a href="#glidepath">(see glide
				path)</a>.</li>

		<li><b>Aircraft symbol</b> - Bearing to target relative to the
			current heading. Tapping on the icon will save the current position
			as a waypoint, which will show up on the map as a green flag.</li>

		<li><b>Dis/Eta</b> - Distance to, time duration to and estimated
		  time of arrival at, selected target, respectively. Tap on the display
			to toggle between the three.</li>

		<li><b>Brg</b> - Bearing to target. Tapping on this window causes
			the reverse course to be shown with a red flag for five seconds.</li>

		<li><b>Gs</b> - Current ground speed</li>

		<li><b>Trk</b> - Track (also indicated by the direction of the
			aircraft symbol). If you tap here, the FLARM Radar view is opened.</li>

		<li><b>Wd/LD</b> - Wind speed and direction toggled with LD by short
			tapping on the display. The LD display shows both the required and
			the current LD to the selected target. See also the <a href="#ld">LD
		  description</a> for more info. A longer tip at the wind label opens
		  the manual wind configuration dialog.</li>

		<li><b>Msl/Std/Agl/Ahl</b> - Current aircraft height in relation
			to MSL, standard pressure, ground altitude below the aircraft or
			altitude of the home site. To get the dialog box sub-menu for
			selecting the height datum, tap on the display.For further
			explanations, see <a href="#altitude">Altitude display</a>.</li>

		<li><b>Var</b> - Variometer display normally derived from the GPS
			altitude. If a peripheral device provides variometer information,
			this is used instead (see <a href="cumulus-settings-gps.html">Settings-GPS
				help page</a>). Tap on the display to bring up a dialog box where you
			can change the integration time and the TEK adjustment.</li>

		<li><b>Mc</b> - The McCready value used for the glide path and
			best speed-to-fly calculations. Tap to open the in-flight dialog for
			changing the expected lift, water ballast amount or deterioration in
			performance due to bugs. This display is only active if a glider has
			been selected. Furthermore the current flight time is displayed, if
			the IGC logger is set to the autostart mode.</li>

		<li><b>S2f/MU</b> - Best airspeed for the current McCready
			setting, wing loading and bug setting. This display is only active if
			a glider and a target are selected. The target is that displayed in
			the <b>To</b> window. Instantaneous variometer information is not
			considered at present: it is set to zero. <br>If you tap on the
			window, it toggles the menu bar, placing it along the top of the
			display. The letters <b>MU</b> may help you remember this.</li>
	</ul>

	Of course all information is displayed in the units you selected in the
	<a href="cumulus-settings-units.html">Settings/Units</a> dialog.

	<h4>Map</h4>

	The map displays a graphical representation of the current position
	(indicated by the intersection of the fuselage and wings of the glider
	symbol) and heading (indicated by the rotation of the glider symbol).
	If there is no GPS fix, Cumulus displays an X symbol instead of a
	glider. See under
	<a href="cumulus-manual.html">Manual Navigation</a> for more details.
	The current scale is displayed in the lower left corner of the map.

	<p>If Cumulus is connected with a Flarm device and the current map
		scale is sufficiently low, the most important object reported by Flarm
		is also drawn on the map as a circle, labeled with the distance and
		the relative vertical separation. In the Flarm display menu a Flarm
		contact can be selected; this object will be displayed on the map too,
		if it is in view.</p>

	<p>
		The map shows the terrain elevation using colours. The detail level of
		this display changes with the zoom factor: more zoom gives more detail
		in the terrain shapes. You can turn off the drawing of elevation on
		the <a href="cumulus-settings-map-objects.html">Settings/Map
			Objects</a> page.
	</p>

	<p>
		Depending on the maps you installed, Cumulus displays airports (the
		type is indicated by the standard ICAO symbol), cities (yellow),
		highways (red/white), roads (red), railways (dark dashed line) and
		water (blue). Not all details are displayed at all zoom factors.
		Cumulus also displays airspace structures, the different types being
		indicated by different colours configurable under <a
			href="cumulus-settings-airspace.html">Settings/Airspaces</a>. For
		basic information on an airport or airspace structure, simply touch
		the related symbol or area on the screen, when the info on the
		interesting object will appear in a pop-up window. The window
		disappears automatically after a certain time that can be configured
		in the <a href="cumulus-settings-information.html">Settings/Information</a>
		menu. <br>If you tip longer as one second at the map the airspace
		status display is opened as popup window. In the display you can see,
		if you are inside of a certain airspace or in its near.
	</p>
	
  <p>
    The display of the runways of an airfield in the information overview
    take place separately per sky direction. The main runways are marked with
    a star symbol. The same is valid for the main radio frequency of an
    airfield.
  </p>
	
	<p>
		If you touch on an airfield icon, you will get detailed information on
		this item. You can add an airfield to your waypoint list if it isn't
		in the list already. Added waypoints will have a <i>normal</i>
		priority.
	</p>

	<p>
		Cumulus can calculate which points are within reach.
		These points have a green background to them. If you
		would arrive below the safety height, the point has a magenta
		background to it. The line to the currently selected waypoint is
		coloured to match, and will be in red if the waypoint is not within
		reach. The safety height margin is set at the <a
			href="cumulus-preflight-settings-common.html#ArrivalAltitude">
			Flight Settings/Common</a> page.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="Status_Bar"></a>Status bar
	</h4>

	The status bar displays the following items (from left to right):

	<p>
		The first item shows the mode Cumulus is operating in. If no GPS
		connection has been established (i.e., Cumulus is in Manual mode), <i>G-0</i>
		will appear, otherwise <i>G-N</i>, where N is the number of satellites
		in use by the GPS receiver.
	</p>

	<p>The next item in the status bar combines a logging and flight
		indicator. If IGC logging is enabled and running, the background is
		green, whereas if the logger is in standby mode (autostart), the
		background is yellow. A grey box means that the logger is not enabled.
		The flight status symbol is shown by one of the character symbols
		below:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>?</b> - Unknown</li>
		<li><b>C</b> - Cruising</li>
		<li><b>L</b> - Circling Left</li>
		<li><b>R</b> - Circling Right</li>
		<li><b>S</b> - Standstill</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The next item shows the number of received Flarm devices. If no Flarms
		are seen, <i>F-0</i> will appear, otherwise <i>F-N</i>, where N is the
		number of received Flarms. Obviously this item is only visible if
		Cumulus is connected to a Flarm device.
	</p>

	<p>The next item in the status bar indicates the current position
		in latitude and longitude.</p>
	<p>The next item shows the glider selected.</p>
	<p>The rest of the status bar is used to display warnings and other
		information.</p>
	<p>
		If you want to maximize the screen area for the map display, you can
		disable the status bar via the menu entry <i>Toggles/Statusbar</i>.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="altitude"></a>Altitude display
	</h4>

	The altitude display can present the aircraft's altitude relative to
	one of four different references. All are derived from the GPS
	altitude, unless pressure altitude information is being provided by an
	external device.

	<ul>

		<li>Msl - Altitude above mean sea level.</li>
		<li>Std - Altitude based on standard pressure, 1013,25 hPa. This
			is used to determine the vertical warning distance to airspaces
			defined by flight levels. As Cumulus does not "know" what the current
			pressure at sea level is, this must be given as (an area) QNH in
			Setup/Pre-flight setup/Common or by using the menu "behind" the
			altitude display (described next).</li>
		<li>Agl - Altitude above ground level. Only available when
			terrain data have been loaded.</li>
		<li>Ahl - Altitude above home site level. Requires the right
			elevation setting of the home site above MSL <a
			href="cumulus-settings-personal.html#HomeSiteElevation">here.</a>
		</li>

	</ul>

	<p>You can very easily change the altitude display reference: just
		tap on the display, and a configuration dialog is opened, where you
		can change the altitude reference, the unit, the height correction
		factor and the QNH. The height correction factor is used to compensate
		the difference between the altitude delivered by the GPS system and
		the true altitude. Both GPS and pressure altitudes often differ from
		the expected altitude.</p>

	<p>
		Another function of this dialog is the calculation and the display of
		the gained altitude. When you press the <i>S</i> button, the
		calculation of your gained altitude is started. The <i>AltGain</i> box
		shows you the height between your deepest and highest point after the
		start button press. That is a good help, if you want to make a certain
		altitude gain as it is required for the silver and gold-C and for the
		5000m diamond.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="glidepath"></a>Glide path
	</h4>

	The glide path indicator gives you an estimate of whether or not your
	selected target is in range. This it calculates using the following
	parameters:

	<ul>
		<li>your current height</li>
		<li>the elevation and range of the target</li>
		<li>the polar values given in the <a
			href="cumulus-settings-glider.html">Settings/Gliders</a> menu.
		</li>
		<li>the mass of the pilot given in the <a
			href="cumulus-preflight-settings-glider.html">Flight Settings
				- Glider</a> menu.
		</li>
		<li>the amount of water ballast carried. The initial amount is
			set before take-off in the <a
			href="cumulus-preflight-settings-glider.html">Flight Settings
				- Glider</a> menu, but if ballast is reduced in flight, then the value
			can be adjusted accordingly in the Mc window's sub-menu.
		</li>
		<li>the reduction in performance by bugs on the wings, also
			adjustable in the Mc window's sub-menu</li>
		<li>the wind strength and direction shown in the Wd window</li>
		<li>the minimum arrival height at the target as set in the <a
			href="cumulus-preflight-settings-common.html#ArrivalAltitude">Flight
				Settings/Common</a> menu.
		</li>
	</ul>

	It is assumed that you fly at the indicated best airspeed, S2f, for the
	currently-set McCready value. If, however, the indicator shows a
	negative value, you are below the glide path and the target is not
	within reach. If you are above the glide path, i.e., the target is
	reachable, you can probably fly a bit faster to reach it sooner,
	depending on the polar of your glider. The theoretical value of the
	speed to fly can be found by adjusting your McCready value in Mc until
	the glide-path indicator shows just slightly positive.

	<h4>
		<a name="ld"></a>LD-Display
	</h4>

	In addition to the glide path indicator you can check your situation
	with the LD display, too. A precondition for the LD calculation is
	likewise that you have selected a target, otherwise nothing is
	displayed. The LD display consists of two values, separated by a slash.
	On the left side is displayed the required LD to the selected target -
	normally this should show positive! The safety height margin and the
	elevation of the target are both taken into account in the calculation.
	On the right side of the slash is displayed the current LD achieved
	over the last 30s. The measurement time can be adjusted on the
	<a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-common.html#ArrivalAltitude">Flight
  Settings/Common</a> page under the headline <i>LD average time</i>.
	<br>
	If the current LD is higher than the required LD,
	you should be on a safe glide path to your selected target. If you have
	climbed or flown at the same altitude over the last whole measurment cycle,
	the display	shows a value like
	<i>&gt;99</i>. If the calculation result is not sensible, a dash is
	shown in the display.
