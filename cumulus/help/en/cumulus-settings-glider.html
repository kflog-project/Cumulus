	<h4 align="center">Settings - Gliders</h4>

	<p>Cumulus supports multiple gliders that you can configure. You
		can then choose the glider you will be using for a particular flight
		from a list and have all the relevant data instantly available. Using
		the buttons above the list, you can add (paper icon), edit (pencil
		icon) or delete (trashcan icon) gliders from your list. As with other
		settings, changes are only stored if you exit the settings dialog with
		the OK (green with the white tick) button. If you accidentally delete
		a glider from your list, just tap the cancel (red with the white x)
		button and you'll be fine.</p>

	<p>
		If you tap the add or edit buttons, you'll be presented with a new
		dialog. Here you can enter information about your glider. The polar is
		used for the final glide calculations. Select your glider from the
		list or enter the correct values for your glider in the boxes. The
		values represent three points on your glider's polar; these are used
		to make an approximation to this curve. These points are given as
		pairs of speed (in km/h) and rate of sink (in m/s). For optimal
		results, take the values at the speed for best L/D as the first point,
		V<sub>Ne</sub> as the third, and a point halfway between these as the
		second point.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The box	<i>Ref. weight:</i> has to contain the dry weight of the
		airplane when	the polar data were measured.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  The box	<i>Load corr.:</i> enables a load correction, if the reference
		weight is not the correct one for your personal airplain.
	</p>
	
	<p>If your glider can carry water, leave the full amount entered here,
		as this value will limit the actual amount you can enter on the
		<a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-glider.html"> Flight
			Settings/Glider</a> menu page. The actual Load correction can also be entered
		on the same page.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  If the <i>Wing area</i> box contains a non zero
		value the <i>Wing load</i> is calculated and displayed on the polar
		page. The unit for the wing area is square meters (m&sup2;), the wing
		load is displayed in Kg/m&sup2;
	</p>

	<p>
		You can see a graphical representation of the resulting polar if you
		select the <b>Show Polar</b> button. Included in this display is
		information on the speed for the best L/D for the selected glider.
		Using the cursor rocker you can simulate wind and lift by pressing the
		up/down (lift) and left/right (wind) buttons. The related tangent is
		calculated, and the best speed-to-fly and resulting sink are displayed
		accordingly. With the <b>Space</b> key you can return to the original
		state of the polar.
	</p>

	<p>
		To add your own types to the selection list, please create your own polar
		file in the <a href="cumulus-file-locations.html">polar directory</a>.
	  Take an existing file in that directory, make a copy of it and edit its content.
		But better would be to send your polar data to the Cumulus team for adding it
	  into the polar directory.
	</p>

	<p>The values for registration and call sign are used in the IGC
		logfile and as a unique identifier for the glider.</p>
