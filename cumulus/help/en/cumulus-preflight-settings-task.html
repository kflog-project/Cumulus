	<h4 align="center">Flight Settings - Task</h4>

	<p>
		Here you have the possibility to define flight tasks. A common
		description about tasks is to find <a href="cumulus-tasks.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h4>Window description</h4>

	In a list overview you can see all defined tasks by you. Select a task
	entry and click the button
	<I>Show</i> to see the details of that task. In the type column you can see
	the assigned task point figures to the task points as little red icons.
	
	<br><br> In the upper line you can see different boxes. In one of them
	you can enter your true air speed TAS you want to fly. Also wind
	direction and wind speed can be entered. Both values are identical with the
	manual wind values, which you can set in
	<a href="cumulus-preflight-settings-wind.html">Flight Settings - Wind</a>.
	That means, you can change the manual wind also via this configuration page.
	
	<br><br>
	If TAS and wind speed are
	greater than zero they will be included in the task calculation. In
	this case you can see under the column TH (true heading) the course to
	be flown to reach the next target. In the other case the column is
	named TC (true course). That means wind speed or TAS are zero. If wind
	triangle calculation fails, you will also see the column TC (true
	course). In such a case wind correction angle (WCA) and ground speed
	(GS) are set to a dash.

	<p>If you leave the menu with the OK button, the selected task is
		 treated as to fly now. In this case the task is drawn on the map.</p>

	<h4>Automatic task point switch</h4>

  Precondition is, you have selected a task before and you are now in the map
  view. Open the task view by touching the <i>To</i> box in the upper left
  corner of the map display.
	To activate the automatic task point switch, you have to press the
	<i>Start</i> button in that view.	That sets the selection to the begin
	point of the task. Alternatively you can select any other point by hand.
	But note the difference. The <i>Start</i> button will always select the
	first approach point of a flight task whilst in the task view you can
	select any point. If you could not touch a task point line, sector or
	circle you must select by hand the next task point. There is no
	automatic switch done to the next point as some GPS devices are doing.

	<p>
		If you select the first approach point already on ground and move
		faster as defined <a
			href="cumulus-preflight-settings-common.html#autologger">here</a>,
		the automatic switch to the next task point will become active. If you
		pass the line or approach into the sector or circle described by the
		task point switch radius, the next task point is selected
		automatically. The common task point switch behaviour can be configured in <a
			href="cumulus-settings-task.html"> Settings-Task</a>. Furthermore you
		have the possibility to edit every task point in the task editor and to overwrite
		the common assigned task point behaviour.
	</p>

	<h4><a name="Taskeditor">Task management</a></h4>

	A selected task can be removed or edited by clicking on the related
	buttons in the right upper corner of the window. If you want to define a
	new task, click on the plus button. This will open a new screen, where
	you can select point data from different list to be used for task definition.
	Use the arrow buttons for moving up/down of task points. The circle button changes
	the order of the task points, the trash button removes a task point. Cloning
	of a task point is possible with the double rectangle button.

	<p>
		Furthermore you can edit single task points by selecting them and
		pressing the pencil button to change their data, the assigned task figure,
		the values of the task figure and the auto zoom flag. A modified task point
		is marked with a yellow background in the type column of the task
		display. Modified task points or the whole task can be reset to the
		configuration default values, which are defined in
		<a href="cumulus-settings-task.html">Settings-Task</a>, with the
		<i>Brush</i> button.
	</p>

  <h4>Import a WeGlide task</h4>
  
  If you press the button <i>Import</i>, a new window is opened and you can
  select a <a href="https://www.weglide.org/">WeGlide</a> task there for
  import. The importer supports only the task type <i>.task</i>. After the import
  the task appears in the task list view.
  
  <h4>Task deactivation</h4>
  
  If a task is activated (selected) in the task list view and you press the
  button <i>Deactivate task</i>, the task is deactivated in Cumulus. That
  means too, the task is removed from the map and from the task view.
