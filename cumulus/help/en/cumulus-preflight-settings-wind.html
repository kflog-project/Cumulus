	<b>Wind</b>

	 <p>
    At this page you can define the different wind settings. Furthermore you get
    displayed a wind statistics about the altitude range.
   </p>
   
	<dl>

		<dt>
			<b>Take Manual Wind</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
		Here you can switch on/off the manual wind. You can do that at any time
		also during the flight in the air. The manual wind is used immediately
		after its activation for the glide path calculation.
		</dd>

		<br>
		<dt>
			<b>Manual Wind WD (direction)</b>
		</dt>

		<dd>
		Clicking the label <i>WD</i> opens a number editor where you can enter a
		value for the wind direction. The direction range covers the interval
		from 0...360° degrees.
		</dd>

    <br>
    <dt>
      <b>Manual Wind WS (speed)</b>
    </dt>

		<dd>
		Clicking the label <i>WS</i> opens a number editor where you can enter a
    value for the wind speed.
		</dd>

    <br>
    <dt>
      <b>Take External Wind</b>
    </dt>
    
    <dd>
    Here you can switch on/off the usage of an external wind source by Cumulus.
    If the external wind is switched on, Cumulus will never calculate its own
    wind. Furthermore you cannot activate the external wind together with the
    manually wind. The external wind is used immediately after its activation
    for the glide path calculation.
    </dd>

    <br>
    <dt>
      <b>Calculate wind in straight flight after ...</b>
    </dt>

    <dd>
    The wind calculation in straight flight can only work, if an external source
    delivers True Heading and IAS (Indicated Air Speed) resp. TAS (True Air
    Speed) next to the GPS data. Such a device is e.g. a XCVariomenter together
    with a compass modul. Here you can define after which time the wind
    calculation should start working. As start criteria count
    
    <ul>
    <li>Heading variations smaller than +-5°</li>
    <li>Speed variations smaller than +- 10Km/h</li>
    </ul>
    
    in the given time frame. So long the conditions are fulfilled, the wind is
    calculated after each second.
    </dd>

    <br>
    <dt>
      <b>Wind Statistics</b>
    </dt>

    <dd>
    The wind statistics shows you the last hour of the wind calculation about
    the altitude range, where wind direction and speed have been calculated
    during circling.
    </dd>
