	<h4 align="center">Flight Settings - Waypoint Import</h4>

	<b>Waypoint Import</b>

	<p>Here you have the possibility to import external waypoint data
		into Cumulus from different sources by using of additional filter
		options.</p>

	<h5>Select</h5>

	In the Select group you define two filter parameters applied during
	read in.

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>
			<DT>
				<B>Type</B>
			</DT>
			<DD>Type of waypoint to be read.</DD>

			<BR>
			<DT>
				<B>Radius</B>
			</DT>
			<DD>Radius around the center point. All waypoints laying inside
				the defined radius are read.</DD>
		</DL>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<h5>Center Point</h5>

	In the Center Point group you define the center position for the radius
	option. Three different possibilities are available:

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<DL>

			<DT>
				<B>Position</B>
			</DT>
			<DD>A user-defined position can be entered here.</DD>

			<BR>
			<DT>
				<B>Homesite</B>
			</DT>
			<DD>The homesite is taken as the center position.</DD>

			<BR>
			<DT>
				<B>Airfield</B>
			</DT>
			<DD>The selected airfield is taken as the center position. Click on the
			    airfield name, to change the selection.
			</DD>

		</DL>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<a name="StorageFormat"></a>
	<h5>Storage Format</h5>

	Cumulus stores the waypoint data in an internal binary format, to save memory
	consumption and to load the files fast again.

	<h5>Storage Priority</h5>

	The priority of the imported waypoints can be changed before insert in
	the global waypoint list. If the priority
	<i>Source</i> is chosen, nothing is changed. Otherwise the selected
	value will overwrite the priority of the imported waypoint.

	<h5>Waypoint Import Management</h5>

	If you press the
	<i>Load</i> button, a file selection dialog box is opened. In this box
	you can navigate to a file to be read in. Supported file formats are:

	<BLOCKQUOTE>
		<UL>
			<li>Cumulus binary format with extension <i>.kwp</i></li>
			<li>SeeYou format with extension <i>.cup</i></li>
			<li>WinPilot or CAI format with extension <i>.dat</i></li>
			<li>British Gliding Association DOS turnpoint file with the extension
			    <i>.dos</i>, to find at
			    <a href="http://www.spsys.demon.co.uk/turningpoints.htm">
			    BGA List of Waypoints</a></li>
		</UL>
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	The selected file is read in by applying the filter options, if the	checkbox
	<i>Filter</i> is active. In a first run the number of imported
	waypoints is counted only and the result is displayed to you. Now you
	can decide, if you accept the result or not. If the result is accepted,
	the waypoints are read in again and put in the global waypoint list of
	Cumulus. If the amount of waypoints is to high for you, you can vary
	the filter parameters and start a new load. Please note, that a new
	waypoint is not added to the global waypoint list, if its name and its
	coordinates are already contained there. Such waypoints are ignored.

	<p>
		<b>Please note the following:</b> Be very carefully with the amount of
		waypoint data to be read in. Too much data needs a lot of run-time
		memory and can have a negative influence on the processor performance!
