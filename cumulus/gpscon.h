 * \brief GPS connection manager.
 *
 * This module manages the startup and supervision of the GPS client process
 * and the communication between this client process and the Cumulus
 * process. All data transfer between the two processes is be done via a
 * socket interface. The path name, used during startup of Cumulus must be
 * passed in the constructor, that the gpsClient resp. gpsMaemoClient binary
 * can be found. It lays in the same directory as Cumulus.
