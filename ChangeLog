[-] 2013-05-18 AP: Bugfix Android: Timeout time for IGC file download from Flarm
                   increased to 10s. That is needed after the last Flarm
                   fimeware update v5.09 otherwise the last IGC file records
                   with the security data are lost.

[-] 2013-05-17 AP: Bugfix: Table in settings airspaces was not moveable with
                   fingers due to a programming issue.
                   
[-] 2013-05-17 AP: Bugfix: Widget flight log book had too big buttons under
                   Android.

[*] 2013-05-13 AP: Cumulus 5.2.0 released.

[o] 2013-05-08 AP: Reset button added to altitude and in-flight dialog. That
                   resets the input field which has the focus to its initial
                   value.

[o] 2013-05-08 AP: New subdirectory igc introduced for storing of IGC files.

[-] 2013-05-07 AP: Bugfix: Flight taskpoint switch did not work at slow speed.
                   If end and landing point of a flight task were the same points
                   the task end was not recognized.

[o] 2013-05-07 AP: Behaviour of altitude, inflight and variometer dialog
                   modified. If a value is changed, the close timer is stopped,
                   so that the user must confirm or reject his done change.

[-] 2013-05-05 AP: Bugfix: Auto logger start speed was never read from
                   the configuration due to a spelling error. Thanks to
                   Robin King who reported the bug to me.

[-] 2013-05-03 AP: Bugfix: The task parser stumbled if a taskpoint contains a
                   comment text with a newline. Comment field removed from the
                   saved tasks file.

[-] 2013-05-01 AP: NMEA simulator expanded that GPS data can also be sent out
                   via a serial device like ttyS0.

[-] 2013-04-28 AP: Bugfix: Needless elevation unit removed in waypoint editor.

[o] 2013-04-26 AP: Class TaskPoint is now derived from SinglePoint and not more
                   from Waypoint. A taskpoint has only the basic data of a
                   single point and its special data. That is clearer to handle.

[o] 2013-04-25 AP: Waypoint editor modified. Two runways can be edited now as
                   single runways. The runway handling has been modified in
                   airfield and waypoint data. The single runway data elements
                   have been replaced by a runway list in these data objects.

[+] 2013-04-24 AP: A XML parser added to import Open AIP data files via the
                   pre-flight waypoint page. Hotspot, navigation aid and
                   airfield data can be imported now.

[+] 2013-04-16 AP: A Debian source package can be build now for the X11 desktop

                   on the map with the mouse/fingers, if a GPS Fix is available.
                   Otherwise the map is moved.

[o] 2013-04-07 AP: Glider Pegase added to gilder polar file.

[-] 2013-04-04 AP: Bugfix: Defined the Cumulus application in the android manifest
                   as persistent. That prevents the destroy of the activity, if
                   the screen is switched off with the power button. The result
                   before after switch screen on was always a black screen.

[o] 2013-04-04 AP: Maximum scale to 1:60 reduced where city labels are drawn.
                   Too much overlapping of labels in the region of Berlin.
                   The former maximum scale was 1:100.

[-] 2013-04-04 AP: Bugfix: Predictive text recognition disabled in QLineEdit
                   class objects to prevent senseless input under Android.

[-] 2013-04-01 AP: Bugfix: Dynamic font calculation for Android made trouble

[-] 2013-03-18 AP: Bugfix: Added a Qt version tag to the compiled data streams
                   of Welt2000 and openair parser to avoid crashes, if you go
                   back from Qt5 to Qt4.
                   
[-] 2013-03-17 AP: Tried to optimize different Qt widgets for a better operation
                   with fingers under Android. A backport of kinetic finger
                   scrolling has been added to all widgets. Also the font
                   adaption to different screens under Android has been approved.

[-] 2013-03-12 AP: Bugfix: QTime has another behavior under Qt5. It must be
                   correct initialized to get an elapsed value.

[+] 2013-01-09 AP: Number input handling completely changed to an own solution
                   with a number keypad widget. That makes the number input
                   handling easier especially under Android where the virtual
                   keyboard made often problems.

[*] 2012-12-23 AP: Cumulus 2.19.2 released. No release produced for Android.

[-] 2012-12-13 AP: Bugfix: Cumulus is crashed, if a new waypoint was added and

                   never displayed in the GPS device list.

[+] 2012-10-24 AP: New feature gain altitude added to altitude dialog. If the
                   S button is pressed, the gained altitude is calculated and
                   displayed in the dialog. That is a cool feature, if you
                   have to make a certain altitude gain, e.g. for the Silver-C,
                   Gold-C or a diamond.

[-] 2012-10-23 AP: Bugfix: Additional checks added in OpenAir parser to prevent

[+] 2012-09-26 AP: Welt2000 update user notification added.

[+] 2012-09-04 AP: Waypoint management made easier. If the waypoint info is
                   requested by the user from the map the info display allows
                   now to delete or edit the shown waypoint. The same is possible
                   if the waypoint info is requested from the waypoint list view.
                   
[-] 2012-09-04 AP: BUGFIX: If a selected target waypoint was edited its data
                   were never updated after editing at the arrival map display

[-] 2012-08-10 AP: BUGFIX: If a task was set and the last taskpoint was
                   selected, the arrival altitude display showed always zero.

[-] 2012-08-07 AP: BUGFIX Android: Shutdown function and flag introduced in
                   jniSupport to avoid message forwarding to C++ GUI part in case
                   of shutdown. Otherwise we can get an exception in the shutdown
                   phase because the C++ part has already terminated but not the
                   java part which delivers GPS data via JNI to the C++ part.

[o] 2012-08-07 AP: Combo boxes for sky directions replaced against toggle buttons

[-] 2012-07-13 AP: Display issue fixed in flight logbook on N8x0.

[o] 2012-07-13 AP: Popup Menu modified. GPS and airspace status moved to an own
                   menu point called Status. New menu entry Flarm Radar added
                   under the menu point View.

                    in preflight gilder page.
                   -Combo selection box altitude reference made available
                    on GPS setting page. If an external GPS device delivers
                    altitude pressure data, e.g. a Flarm, these data can be
                    used now.
                   -Android menu structure reworked. Hide/show of left map
                    info boxes added.
                   -Different labels and widgets better adapted to Android.

[-] 2012-06-25 AP: Wind calculation did not work under Android, if no NMEA
                   raw data are available. Motorola Defy is an example for that. 
                   
[+] 2012-06-25 AP: Android location data are forwarded to GPS status dialog
                   terminal window, if no NMEA raw data are available. That
                   makes an analysis possible also in that case. Motorola
                   Defy is an example for that.                

[o] 2012-06-25 AP: Altimeter settings dialog modified, that the altitude
                   reference (GPS/Pressure) can also be changed in it.

                   toggled now in its visibility by using the shortcut
                   key D. That was a wish from different Android users.

[*] 2012-06-14 AP: Cumulus 2.14.0 released.

[+] 2012-06-12 AP: New airspace status display added, that shows the user
                   an overview, if airspaces are violated or if he is in the
                   near of an airspace. Pressing at the map for 750ms
                   opens a popup widget with the airspace information.
                   Furthermore the display can be opened via the menu.

[*] 2012-05-26 AP: Cumulus 2.13.3 released. It was made only for Maemo4.

[-] 2012-06-08 AP: BUGFIX: Flight trail option was not changeable in setup
                   page map objects.

[o] 2012-06-08 AP: QFontDialog replaced by an own programmed font dialog because

[-] 2012-06-07 AP: BUGFIX: Popup of software input panel reenabled for color
                   dialogs in general setup. That is only valid for Android.

[+] 2012-06-05 AP: New option introduced in setup airspace, which allows to skip
                   airspaces laying over a predefined vertical border. I found
                   an airspace file with a lot of information in the upper
                   airspace, which are not more of interest for glider pilots.
                   With the help of this option you can filter out upper
                   airspaces now.
                   
[-] 2012-06-05 AP: Option force drawing ... in setup airspace removed. It caused
                   sometimes a lot of unwanted warnings.         

[*] 2012-05-26 AP: Cumulus 2.13.1 released. It was only for Android made.

[o] 2012-05-25 AP: If the Android user has German Language selected, the native
                   Cumulus part will also use the German surface now after startup.

[*] 2012-05-24 AP: Cumulus 2.13.0 released

[-] 2012-05-24 AP: A forwarded close event from Android's Java part caused often
                   a core dump in the C++ part, when it was sent to other
                   widgets as the main window. Therefore I decided to handle
                   close events only in the main window. All other widgets have
                   an integrated close button for that.

[+] 2012-05-19 AP: Classical menubar replaced by a context popup menu. That
                   prevents that the space of the map display is reduced when
                   the menu is opened.

[+] 2012-05-19 AP: Flight trail drawing introduced. The last 5 minutes are drawn
                   as trail on the map. Trail drawing can be switched on/off via
                   the context menu.

[o] 2012-05-18 AP: Logger backtrack storage changed from 30 to 60 entries. The
                   backtrack storage saves the logger records before a take off
                   is recognized in auto mode to have a good ground line.

[o] 2012-05-04 AP: Under Android a Qt window splitter is not operable with
                   fingers. Therefore I changed the window layout of the preflight
                   task page. Now only the listed tasks are to see, if you enter
                   the page. If a task is selected and you press the show button,
                   the task content is displayed on the task page instead of the
                   task list. I think that is a better solution as before.
                   For both widgets is now more space available.

[-] 2012-04-27 AP: BUGFIX: Software Input Panel was disabled for airspace
                   download in settings airspace. Is fixed now.

[+] 2012-04-24 AP: German translation of Java part added for Android.

[+] 2012-04-24 AP: Screen saver control added for Android.

[o] 2012-04-19 AP: Font handling optimized for different hardware devices.

[o] 2012-04-19 AP: Landmark pixmap enlarged from 8x8 pixels to 10x10 pixels
                   to make it better visible at the map.

[-] 2012-04-16 AP: If the glider load or water ballast was modified, the wing
                   load was never updated on the preflight glider page. I fixed
                   that.

[*] 2012-04-16 AP: Cumulus 2.12.3 released

[-] 2012-04-16 AP: BUGFIX: Due to a programming error the wind calculation
                   did not work as expected. I notice that on my first cross
                   country flight in this year. This bug is fixed now.

[+] 2012-04-13 AP: A Java Bluetooth service class added for Android to make it
                   possible to connect external Bluetooth GPS devices and to get
                   NMEA raw data.

[*] 2012-04-04 AP: Cumulus 2.12.2 released

[+] 2012-04-03 AP: Different adaptions added to the source code in the last
                   two months for the Android Qt port. Could not overcome
                   all Android Qt issues with workarounds.

-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.12.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.8.1)
-------------------------------------------------

[o] 2012-03-23 AP: To overcome the hidden restrictions of a QMessageBox an
                   own solution was programmed for the disclaimer display at
                   program start.

[o] 2012-03-21 AP: GUI surface partly reworked. OK and Cancel button of some
                   widgets moved to a new position where an unwanted press
                   should not happen during normal operation.

[o] 2012-03-21 AP: Fonts can use point size or pixel size. Both in parallel is
                   not possible. Tried to make more generic the setting of an
                   own font size according to the used default (points or pixels).

[o] 2012-03-20 AP: Operation of Flarm alias list modified. A double click on a
                   table column was not so easy to execute. Now if a cell is
                   clicked an extra dialog is opened to handle the input for
                   that cell. Rows can be selected by clicking the left row
                   number button.

[-] 2012-03-06 AP: Zoom issue fixed in help browser.

[o] 2012-02-01 AP: The waypoint default type is set to landmark now, if the
                   waypoint editor is opened for waypoint creation.

[-] 2012-02-01 AP: Missing time zone item UTC added to sunset in the arrival
                   display.

[o] 2012-01-16 AP: Method determineFlightStatus of Calculator class modified.
                   The flight status detection should now work safer and faster
                   as before.

[+] 2012-01-15 AP: New option skip added to NMEA simulator. This option allows
                   to skip a number of lines in a file to be played.

[*] 2012-01-11 AP: Cumulus 2.12.1 released

[+] 2012-01-11 AP: New option play added to NMEA simulator. This option allows
                   to use a NMEA data file as data source.

[o] 2012-01-11 AP: All Qt default spinboxes are replaced by own improved solutions.
                   That should make the operation more user friendly now.

[o] 2012-01-10 AP: Class HSpinBox renamed to VarSpinBox. The new class can
                   arrange the buttons vertical or horizontal. That is controlled
                   by an enumeration parameter.

[+] 2012-01-05 AP: New class HSpinBox added. This class contains a spinbox
                   which has the buttons at the left and right side arranged
                   to make it possible, to use the fingers for the operation.

[o] 2012-01-04 AP: Spinbox operation of preflight glider, task and common pages
                   changed to extra plus and minus button. That makes the
                   operation possible by using fingers.

[o] 2012-01-03 AP: Co-pilot name and current water ballast are saved now, if the
                   pre-flight dialog is left with the OK button.

[*] 2011-12-24 AP: Cumulus 2.12.0 released

[o] 2011-12-23 AP: Flight mode wave removed. It is not clearly to decide, when
                   a glider is flying in the wave.

[+] 2011-12-23 AP: If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode the current
                   flight time is displayed now in the flight parameters
                   dialog. This dialog is opened by pressing the Mc display box.
                   
[+] 2011-12-22 AP: If the IGC logger operates in auto start mode and the flight
                   mode changes to unknown or still stand, the logfile is
                   automatically closed after 90s now.

-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.12.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.8.0)
-------------------------------------------------

[-] 2011-12-21 AP: Wrong entry in file glider.pol fixed.

[+] 2011-12-21 AP: Reachable list overworked. Two buttons added for page
                   scrolling. If an entry is selected and the list is scrolled
                   no jump more to the selected position after a list update.
                   That makes the viewing of the list easier for the user.

[+] 2011-12-20 AP: If the flight state is cruising and a target is selected,
                   a relative bearing information is displayed at the top of the
                   map, if this option is activated in the map object menu.
                   The relative bearing information shows the necessary direction
                   and the degrees of correction to be made to fly directly to
                   the target.
                   
[+] 2011-12-19 AP: Wing load value added to pre-flight glider page and to
                   glider polar drawing.

[-] 2011-12-11 AP: The navigate to home button function did not set the
                   home elevation. That caused a wrong arrival altitude display.
                   The problem was difficult to recognize, if the home site
                   elevation is low. But in Gariep Dam in South Africa I
                   detected the issue because it lays ca. 1300m above MSL.

[+] 2011-12-08 AP: If a target is selected, the drawing of a track line can be
                   activated now in the task setup configuration menu. The track
                   line shows the current movement direction. So you can easier
                   see, if you are on the bearing line to your selected target
                   or not.

[o] 2011-11-25 AP: New cross button added to waypoint list view. Pressing the
                   button will remove all waypoint entries of the list after
                   confirmation. That make it easier and faster to clear the
                   whole list as using the select all and remove feature.
                   
[+] 2011-11-25 AP: On the Linux desktop the mouse wheel can be used now for
                   zoom actions.

[o] 2011-11-18 AP: Map type highway renamed to motorway according to OSM
                   usage.

[o] 2011-11-16 AP: Waypoint import routine for cup files enhanced, that also
                   runway length values can be handled using unit feet. That is
                   not conform to the SeeYou specification but I saw that in
                   a south African waypoint file.

[o] 2011-10-28 AP: The type of an user added waypoint by pressing the bearing
                   icon was changed from turnpoint to landmark. The middle
                   position of a square is better to see at the map as a lot of
                   flags.

[-] 2011-10-24 AP: The first airspace of an airspace file was never loaded. It
                   is fixed now.

[o] 2011-10-23 AP: SeeYou waypoint import filter modified.

[+] 2011-10-21 AP: Disclaimer tabulator added to AboutWidget.

[+] 2011-10-20 AP: Added a new button to the FLARM radar view to make it easier
                   to add alias names for hexadecimal Flarm Identifiers. A
                   selected Flarm object can be assigned an alias name now by
                   using the plus button.

[+] 2011-10-06 AP: City labels are drawn at the map now, if the scale is less
                   than 100. But some of the city labels are wrong. That seems
                   to be a problem in the KFLog data base.

[*] 2011-09-29 AP: Cumulus 2.11.0 released      

-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.11.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.7.4)
-------------------------------------------------

[+] 2011-09-21 AP: Map can be moved now by pressing left mouse button and mouse
                   move to a new position in manual mode. That works a little
                   bit slow but it works ;-)
[+] 2011-09-21 AP: New waypoint import filter added for WinPilot or CAI waypoint
                   files with extension '.dat'.
[+] 2011-09-09 AP: New configuration option "Save NMEA Data" added to GPS
                   settings page. If the checkbox is enabled, all GPS NMEA
                   records are logged into a file. The file is located in
                   the user's data directory. The file name is CumulusNmea.log.
                   One backup with the name CumulusNmea.log.old is created from
                   a previous log file, when a new log file is opened.
                   
 *  2011-06-30 AP: Cumulus 2.10.5 released      
                   
[-] 2011-06-30 AP: BUGFIX: Waypoint import failed for Seeyou cup data file,
                   if elevation unit was given in feet. Fixed now.
[-] 2011-06-29 AP: BUGFIX: Problems fixed in coordinate editor.
[-] 2011-06-29 AP: BUGFIX: Problems fixed in Debian changelog files for Maemo4
                   and Maemo5.
[o] 2011-06-26 AP: Polar data added for SZD-32 Foka 5 to glider.pol file.
[o] 2011-06-15 AP: Different new glider added to the polar file.
[o] 2011-06-15 AP: Only the first GPS fix after startup is reported additionally
                   by a sound. All other status changes are signaled by changing
                   the background color of the GPS status display. That prevents
                   annoying sounds, if the GPS receiver plays ping pong in its
                   fix reporting. I had often that case, e.g. during the journey
                   by train or by aircraft.
[-] 2011-06-14 AP: BUGFIX: Unknow waypoint types read in by Seeyou import
                   method are set to type landmark now and not more to not
                   selected.
[-] 2011-06-14 AP: BUGFIX: Integer validators in coordinate input boxes makes
                   trouble on some values. Leading zeros were removed. I
                   replaced them by QRegExpValidators.
[-] 2011-05-23 AP: BUGFIX: If the altitude unit was changed, the arrival display
                   was forgotten to update immediately. Until to the next real
                   change of the glide path a wrong value was displayed.
[+] 2011-05-23 AP: Task editor modified. Only allowed command buttons are enabled
                   to see better the possible actions. Inserting of a new task
                   point is done now after the current selected position and
                   not always at the end of the list. That prevents senseless
                   move up actions.
[+] 2011-05-16 AP: Tipping on a task point of an imported task shows now
                   the detailed information of the task point.
[+] 2011-05-14 AP: If a flight task was imported from another source and the
                   flight points were not contained in the Cumulus waypoint
                   list, only a course line was drawn at the map but no points.
                   I added small black squares to the drawing method of the
                   flight task to show the flight task points in every case.                   
[-] 2011-05-13 AP: Robin King reported me, that the GPS status window is blocking
                   the Cumulus GUI on its N810. I investigated that and found
                   out, that the drawing performance of the satellite status
                   views was bad. I could tune it over 70%. An other issue
                   was the GPS message display. If the programmed range of
                   displayed messages is to high (250 at the moment), the
                   message rotate causes an huge processor load. I limited
                   the message display to 100 messages and used a simple
                   QLabel to display them instead of a QTextEdit widget.
                   That has helped together with a timer controlled update
                   to reduce the processor load from 80% to 20% on a N810.
[-] 2011-05-10 AP: BUGFIX: The G-Lib main loop of the gpsMaemoClient did not
                   work as expected by me. A Cumulus user reported to me, that
                   messages from the internal N900 GPS device were delayed
                   processed. I modified some details to get it right working
                   now.
[o] 2011-05-03 AP: Modified the waypoint delete method to become faster, if
                   many waypoints shall be removed.
[-] 2011-04-30 AP: BUGFIX: Changes in airspace filling and airspace warning
                   dialogs are never saved.
[+] 2011-04-28 AP: A new configuration option, arrival altitude display, was
                   added to the pre-flight common page. This option defines,
                   for which task point the arrival altitude is calculated.
                   Possible selections are next task point or landing task
                   point. The default setting is the landing task point.
                   This was a request from Hendrik Hoeth.
[o] 2011-04-28 AP: If Cumulus had more than 5 Flarm devices in sight the GUI
                   was nearly blocked for user interactions. The problem was
                   a bottleneck in the communication between the GPS client and
                   the Cumulus process due to to much handshake actions. This
                   fix should improve in general the GUI reaction time for
                   user interactions.
[+] 2011-04-06 AP: New menu item added under toggles for changing window size
                   between normal size and maximized. The same can be done
                   with the key SPACE.
[+] 2011-04-06 AP: If the speed to fly box is unused, normally if no target
                   is selected, the whole box is labeled with the text string
                   Menu. That make it easier to find the toggle for the menu
                   bar.
[-] 2011-04-06 AP: Did some bug fixing in class MapInfo. The frame of the
                   arrival info box was always drawn in a wrong color. I fixed
                   that.
[o] 2011-04-05 AP: Task management widgets a little bit optimized in their
                   layout.
[+] 2011-04-05 AP: If a flight task is selected, a file with the name
                   cumulus-flarm.tsk is saved in the user's data directory.
                   The content of this file can be used as input for the
                   flarm.cfg file on the Micro SD card.
[-] 2011-04-04 AP: Bugfix: readCup method of WaypointCatalog set never the
                   landing flags for outlandings.
[o] 2011-04-02 AP: Home site country field added to settings personal page.
[o] 2011-04-01 AP: Found an Italian OpenAir file where the single records
                   started with the airspace name and not with the airspace
                   class definition as expected. Cumulus read that but all
                   airspaces had wrong names. I changed the OpenAir parser
                   in that manner, that both item orders are read correct now.                   
[o] 2011-03-30 AP: A thread is introduced for reload of Welt2000 to avoid a
                   longer GUI blocking during reload.
[o] 2011-03-28 AP: Configuration dialogs airspace filling and warnings are
                   not more preloaded, if configuration settings widget is
                   opened.
[o] 2011-03-28 AP: Reading of compiled Welt2000 and airspace files tuned by
                   preallocation of list elements. That reduces the processing
                   time a little bit.
[+] 2011-03-28 AP: Added an airspace file selection window to settings airspace.
                   That allows to define the airspace files to be loaded from
                   the airspace file directory. That makes the airspace file load
                   management easier because you can select now your needed files
                   from a pool of airspace files.
[+] 2011-03-27 AP: Runway length added to reachable list view.
[+] 2011-03-27 AP: Waypoint page of preflight widget enhanced by a combo box
                   to change the priority of imported waypoints. That make it
                   easier to adapt the import handling to the personal desires.
[+] 2011-03-27 AP: Waypoint list view enhanced by a toggle button to display
                   all or only a subset of waypoints. The subset is defined
                   by the waypoint priority, which can be low, normal or high.
[o] 2011-03-16 AP: Country and radius filter options of airfield configuration
                   page are both active now. That makes country filtering
                   more sensitive.
                   One backup copy of a default waypoint file is now created
                   before every new storage action. That shall ensue a fall back
                   possibility, if new storing was unwantedly.
                   Qt version check added to global Makefile and qmake project
                   files to prevent a build under X11 with a wrong Qt release.                  
[o] 2011-03-11 AP: Country code added to all kinds of single points. Different
                   internal format changes done for elevation and frequency.
[o] 2011-03-10 AP: Waypoint names limited to 8 characters and they consists
                   only of upper cases. Waypoint editor adapted to this new
                   requirements. Runway headings are limited to the range
                   10...36. Bug fixing in waypoint catalog methods.                   
[+] 2011-03-09 AP: More than one waypoint can be removed in the waypoint list
                   view now.
                   Preflight widget expanded by a waypoint page. This page
                   allows to import waypoints from different formats. Supported
                   formats are XML and binary formats of KFLog and SeeYou cup
                   formats. Cumulus can store now waypoints in the KFLog binary
                   or XML format.
[-] 2011-03-09 AP: BUGFIX: Coding error in GeneralConig class fixed. Waypoint
                   configuration items were not stored correctly.

Cumulus 2.10.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.7.2)
-------------------------------------------------
                
[o] 2011-02-21 AP: Two new Czech glider polars added to glider.pol on request by
                   Radek Pospisil.
[o] 2011-02-14 AP: File codec in openair parser and Welt2000 set to
                   "ISO 8859-15". That ensures, that German umlauts are
                   interpreted right during read in.
[o] 2011-01-14 AP: Airfield drawing method made more generic.
[-] 2011-01-13 AP: BUGFIX: Welt2000 has changed the identifier for gliderfields.
                   Parser modified to the new identifier.
[o] 2011-01-07 AP: Altitude method of openair parser extended. The terms GROUND
                   and the unit extension ALT are added. These items were
                   contained in an openair file of South Africa. 
                   ALT is the altitude in feet with local QNH set, i.e. height
                   above MSL. Thanks to Hendrik Stheeman for his explanation.
                   The openair file is to find here:
                   http://soaringweb.org/TP/Magalies/gautng10.txt
[-] 2011-01-06 AP: BUGFIX: Do only provide the languages in settings personal,
                   which are really installed. The English language is always
                   the default language.
[-] 2010-12-21 AP: BUGFIX: Class SinglePoint placed drawn icons not in the
                   center of its middle point.
[o] 2010-12-09 AP: Doxygen error complains in source code fixed. For most of
                   the classes Doxygen class descriptions have been added.
[+] 2010-12-08 AP: New widget class AboutWidget introduced to display about and
                   team data of Cumulus.
[o] 2010-12-05 AP: English help pages (GPS/Display) checked in reviewed
                   by Robin King. Thanks to him for his good work.
[o] 2010-12-05 AP: English help pages (Flarm) checked in reviewed by Robin King.
                   Thanks to him for his good work.
[o] 2010-11-30 AP: BUGFIX: Map redraw was partly blocked during a resize event.
                   That was a leftover from the Zaurus time. Did remove the
                   block. That ensures that the map is always updated after
                   a resize event. Thanks to Robin King for his hint.
[o] 2010-11-17 AP: All language build actions extracted from Makefile.Maemo4
                   and put into a new file with name Makefile.Language. The
                   Language build process does not depends on a single
                   Maemo release.
[-] 2010-11-16 AP: Several resize issues fixed on glider page.
[+] 2010-11-15 AP: German Qt library translations added to language package.
[-] 2010-11-12 AP: Several resize issues fixed on task page.
[o] 2010-11-10 AP: WaitScreen class reworked.
[o] 2010-11-10 AP: Qt 4.7.1 is used now for the build process of Maemo4. The
                   graphic system raster was chosen as default.

-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.9.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.7.1)
-------------------------------------------------

[+] 2010-11-10 AP: Setup of a style proxy to make some widget elements larger
                   on Maemo. E.g. the very small tab bar buttons are enlarged.
[-] 2010-11-03 AP: BUGFIX: Wrong floating point formatting fixed in GPS
                   simulator, if language is not C on N8x0 and N900. The decimal
                   point was replaced by a comma.
[+] 2010-11-03 AP: Bluetooth GPS devices can be directly connected by Cumulus
                   now. That ensures the full access to their reported NMEA
                   stream. LibLocation of Maemo4 and Maemo5 provides only
                   GPS basic data and that is sometimes to less.
[+] 2010-11-03 AP: GPS sentence filter added to daemon process, to ensure that
                   only well known NMEA sentences are processed and forwarded
                   to the Cumulus GUI process.
[o] 2010-10-18 AP: Welt2000 has changed the file name. The date part was
                   removed and the name is now WELT2000.TXT.
[o] 2010-10-15 AP: Several dialog windows changed to a tool window because
                   dialog windows have a special layout under Maemo5. The dialog
                   layout of Maemo5 uses not all available space of the parent
                   window and is fully expanded in the horizontal dimension.
[o] 2010-10-14 AP: Altitude display added to altimeter dialog because under
                   Maemo5 the dialog layout hides completely the altitude
                   display of the map.
[o] 2010-10-13 AP: Window type of GPS status dialog changed from dialog to
                   window. That was necessary for Maemo5 at the N900 device
                   because dialogs there have a special look and do not allow
                   to use the whole window space.
[o] 2010-10-13 AP: Help browser extended by font zoom buttons.
[+] 2010-10-12 AP: German language package created and provided now for Maemo.
[o] 2010-10-11 AP: English and German online help pages reworked. A PDF file
                   is provided now for every language on the web page.
[o] 2010-10-04 AP: Allow move to home site also if GPS has no valid fix.
[-] 2010-09-22 AP: BUGFIX: Wrong frequency conversion fixed in case of
                   undefined frequency in Welt2000 parser.
[o] 2010-09-02 AP: Wind calculation partly reworked.
[-] 2010-09-01 AP: BUGFIX: Additional handling added to ~GpsCon to prevent
                   GPS client zombies.
[-] 2010-09-01 AP: BUGFIX: Method recalculateWind() of class WindStore emitted
                   sometimes invalid wind values. That removed the current
                   displayed wind value and arrow from the map.
[-] 2010-09-01 AP: BUGFIX: Method addMeasurement of class WindMeasurementList
                   used wrong method for add list element. That disabled the
                   maximum element control of the list.
[-] 2010-09-01 AP: BUGFIX: Method setLimit of class LimitedList did not
                   work properly.
[o] 2010-08-24 AP: Menu structure redesigned.
[+] 2010-08-20 AP: Flarm alias handling added as new feature.
[o] 2010-08-17 AP: NMEA simulator extended by a new option. Up to 10 different
                   GPS sentences can be passed by using the sentence0 to
                   sentence9 option. That make it easier to test FLARM features.
[o] 2010-08-16 AP: Obsolete class QMatrix replaced by QTransform in MapMatrix.
[o] 2010-08-11 AP: Checksum of GPS sentences is checked now in the receiver
                   process and not more in the GpsNmea class. That shall save
                   performance in Cumulus.
[+] 2010-08-02 AP: Sentence $PGRMZ added to NMEA simulator for a better
                   FLARM simulation.
[-] 2010-07-28 AP: BUGFIX: Altitude of GPS Sentence $PGRMZ was taken as meter
                   and not as foot. That caused a wrong display.
[+] 2010-07-15 AP: Flarm radar and list view added as new features. Tip on
                   track label in map view will open it.
[o] 2010-07-01 AP: Calculation of elevation was done twice in Calculator class
                   but there was no need for that. That coast performance.
                   Thanks to Peter Turczak who gave me the hint ;-)
[+] 2010-06-30 AP: If a Flarm device is connected as GPS source, the most
                   important reported object by Flarm is drawn at the map.
                   Drawing is bound to the current map scale level. If map
                   scale level is less than 60 the Flarm object is drawn as
                   a circle and labeled with the distance and the relative
                   vertical separation.
[o] 2010-06-30 AP: Removed menu label in status bar. It was difficult to hit
                   with the stylus. As alternative the menu toggle was added
                   to the speed to fly box located right beside the McCready
                   display. Now the menu toggle can be operated by finger use.
[o] 2010-06-30 AP: Map scale bar was bad to recognize because the scale unit
                   was drawn in the middle of it. Moved the scale unit label
                   above the scale bar. 
[o] 2010-06-30 AP: Map info display boxes make some trouble in alignment and
                   color under Qt 4.6.3. Tried to fix that.
[+] 2010-06-29 AP: The features Flarm and Internet download can be switched
                   on or off by configuration items in the qmake project file.
[-] 2010-06-29 AP: BUGFIX: Copy constructor of class Polar was incomplete.
                   The items _seats and _maxWater were never considered.
                   That caused funny results in polar drawing. That was
                   a very old bug not caused by the Qt port.
[-] 2010-06-28 AP: BUGFIX: Spin box limits in GilderEditor were partly set to
                   small. Vertical speed unit knots did not work properly
                   in polar drawing. Thanks to Paul Scorer for his hint ;-)
[-] 2010-06-27 AP: BUGFIX: Wrong polar entry for glider 1-26E fixed.
[-] 2010-06-27 AP: BUGFIX: Minus sign of variometer was not right aligned
                   in the middle of the pre-text field.
[+] 2010-06-23 AP: New class Flarm added to handle Flarm specific stuff.
                   NMEA parser extended to extract $PFLAA sentence emitted by
                   Flarm. All Flarm stuff is enclosed in conditional defines
                   to make it easy on/off switchable.
[o] 2010-06-22 AP: Position of altitude and variometer display swapped to make
                   altitude display visible on MAEMO if altitude dialog is
                   opened.
[+] 2010-06-22 AP: MapInfoBox widget enlarged, that units can be also displayed
                   in the pre-text field. The altitude display uses that now.
[+] 2010-06-22 AP: Altitude user dialog enlarged by QNH and unit setting and
                   altitude leveling. Leveling can adjust displayed GPS or
                   pressure altitude on ground, if there is a constant offset
                   in the expected values. QNH and unit can be changed in flight
                   easier as before by using fingers.
[o] 2010-06-21 AP: Altitude selection in Gps settings page reduced to GPS and
                   Pressure. Altitude user correction has been moved to the
                   altitude user dialog.
[-] 2010-06-21 AP: Feature toggle altimeter unit on tip removed from MapView and
                   from the information setting page.
[+] 2010-06-10 AP: NMEA parser extended to extract $PFLAU sentence emitted by
                   Flarm. GPS status is taken over from this sentence.
[+] 2010-06-10 AP: GPS status dialog enlarged by Start/Stop and Save button.
                   Start/Stop controls the NMEA display and with save the
                   content of the display is written into a file.
[-] 2010-06-04 AP: BUGFIX: If a task is replaced by another one and the flight
                   logger is already running, the user is asked now, if he wants
                   to open a new log file. Otherwise the new task declaration
                   cannot written into the current logfile. That is not allowed
                   according to the IGC specification. Thanks to Robin King for
                   this bug report.                 
[o] 2010-06-03 AP: Task start button added to task list view, that there is no
                   need to use the keypad B letter.
[-] 2010-06-02 AP: BUGFIX: If a task is replaced by another one and it exist a
                   target selection, the start point of the new task is selected
                   as the new target.
[o] 2010-06-02 AP: Welt2000 download link updated.
[o] 2010-06-02 AP: Option page size in airfield settings removed. Two buttons
                   added at the right widget side for page up and down move
                   to airfield, outlanding and waypoint list views. Loaded
                   lists are freed now, if the list views are closed to spare
                   memory and reloaded at first show event.
[o] 2010-06-01 AP: ListViewFilters redesigned and performance optimized.
[o] 2010-06-01 AP: Class WpListWidgetParent renamed to ListWidgetParent. Up and
                   down page buttons removed to have more space for the list
                   items at a page.
[o] 2010-05-16 AP: Display widget in TpInfoWidget and WpInfoWidget changed from
                   QLabel to QTextEdit to ensure the display of longer text.
                   QTextEdit enables scroll bars if necessary.
[o] 2010-05-16 AP: Task radii value in spin boxes enlarged to 1000.
[-] 2010-05-11 AP: BUGFIX: Core dump fixed in task switch management. Thanks
                   to Robin King who has detect it and informed me.
[o] 2010-05-04 AP: Class Polar can handle different units now. Drawing of polar
                   improved for slow gliders.
[o] 2010-05-04 AP: Polar object in class Glider changed from pointer to value.
[o] 2010-05-04 AP: Polar list in GliderEditor changed from pointer to value list.
                   List is sorted after loading now and supports different units.
[-] 2010-05-04 AP: BUGFIX: GliderListWidget did not sort the list of gliders
                   at the first load.
[-] 2010-05-03 AP: BUGFIX: Different problems in polar drawing fixed. Drawing
                   enabled for slow flying gliders. Different units can be
                   used in polar settings now.
[o] 2010-05-01 AP: Status bar made a little bit bigger for MAEMO.
[o] 2010-05-01 AP: New position display in status bar limited to 5s, if
                   GPS has a fix. That shall decrease the X-Server load.
                   In manual mode every position change is displayed.
[+] 2010-05-01 AP: New method calcFlarmPos added to class WGSPoint to calculate
                   FLARM positions from FLARM data.
[o] 2010-05-01 AP: Performance tuning in GpsNmea class by eliminating needless
                   call backs from slots caused by missing values in emitted
                   signal. Needed values added to the signal call.
[o] 2010-04-29 AP: Welt2000 download link updated in airfield settings .
[o] 2010-04-29 AP: Performance tuning in MapInfoBox class. Dynamic layout was
                   to often recalculated. Caused a lot of overhead. Furthermore
                   found a possible endless while loop where font size became
                   negative.
[o] 2010-04-27 AP: Performance tuning in Distance, Altitude and Speed classes.
[-] 2010-04-27 AP: Bugfix: GPS user altitude and user altitude correction
                   were not taken over in GPS module after a user modification.
[o] 2010-04-25 AP: Fall back to old GPS connection solution for the N8x0 due to
                   stochastic altitude reporting of LibLoaction service.
[+] 2010-04-23 AP: Width of the bearing course line is taken over from the
                   configured task course line width.
[+] 2010-04-22 AP: Setting tabulator Sector renamed to Task. Added two new
                   configuration items for task course line color and width.
                   Was desired from Robin King.
[o] 2010-04-22 AP: Background color of arrival info box is set to red, if
                   arrival altitude becomes negative.
[-] 2010-04-21 AP: Bugfix: Connection to NMEA simulator was never established
                   after GPS interface change due to MAEMO5.
[o] 2010-04-21 AP: Labels of map info boxes in map view set to an uniform width.
                   The width of the greatest text is taken for all boxes.
[+] 2010-04-20 AP: New altitude kind, above home site level added. You can set
                   the home site elevation under personal settings and if the
                   altitude kind AHL (above home site level) is selected you get
                   displayed the altitude above your home site position.
                   Was desired from Robin King.
[o] 2010-04-13 AP: Mouse snap radius increased to 25 pixels on MAEMO. That shall
                   ensure a better hit of icons with the finger on the map.
[+] 2010-04-13 AP: NMEA parser extended. Barometric altitude emitted by FLARM
                   in sentence PGRMZ is now extracted by Cumulus.
[o] 2010-04-13 AP: The new client process gpsMaemoClient is also used now by
                   MAEMO4. The differences between LibLocation in MAEMO4 and
                   MAEMO5 are not so big and Cumulus uses again an uniform inter-
                   face in both cases.
[o] 2010-04-12 AP: QRegion usage replaced by QPainterPath. That increased the
                   map drawing performance in general. Thanks again to Peter
                   Turczak, he found out that.
[o] 2010-04-08 AP: HTTP download manager modified that all queued downloads are
                   canceled if an network error occurred. That prevents now
                   a flood of error messages. If the user has automatic downloads
                   enabled this is also reset in such a case. 
[-] 2010-04-08 AP: BUGFIX: Cumulus did crash if the user has not confirmed an
                   aborted download.
[o] 2010-04-06 PT: Speed up map projection patch provided by Peter Turczak.
                   Improves map drawing on large scales by 20%.
[-] 2010-04-01 AP: BUGFIX: Base filename was not correctly derived from source
                   filename in openair parser if the source name contains more
                   than one dot.
[o] 2010-03-31 AP: Flight dialog modified to better finger usage.
[o] 2010-03-30 AP: Variometer dialog modified to better finger usage.
                   Tek calculation adjustment modified. If not circling ground
                   speed is taken as basis.
[o] 2010-03-25 AP: Task editor widget was a dialog, changed it to a tool window.
[+] 2010-03-25 AP: New method isMounted added to class HwInfo to get information
                   about mounted MMC cards.
[o] 2010-03-25 AP: Help browser is opened now in the same size as the parent.
                   On tablet means that also maximized, if parent is maximized.
[-] 2010-03-24 AP: BUGFIX: Http prefix removed from proxy environment setting.
[-] 2010-03-24 AP: BUGFIX: Wrong Mc value decoding from Cambrigde device fixed.
[o] 2010-03-18 AP: N900 hardware items added to HwInfo class.
[+] 2010-03-18 AP: Process environment is checked for http_proxy variable, if
                   no proxy has been defined by the user in Cumulus. If the
                   variable is defined it is taken as default proxy in
                   the related widgets.
[o] 2010-03-16 AP: Nokia has replaced in Maemo5 the traditional GPSD daemon by
                   another internal processes. The location services must be taken
                   now to get the GPS data. Therefore a new client process with
                   the name gpsMaemoClient has been added to Cumulus to handle
                   that.
[o] 2010-03-16 AP: NMEA parser extracts too the satellites in use now.
                   Some signals in NMEA parser modified. The change information
                   is added to them to avoid unneeded callbacks.
[-] 2010-03-16 AP: BUGFIX: Satellites in use have to be recorded by IGC logger
                   and not satellites in view.
[+] 2010-03-08 AP: New dialog added for downloading of airspaces in Settings
                   Airspaces.
[-] 2010-03-07 AP: BUGFIX: Cumulus did crash if the GPS device was changed
                   from the GPS Daemon to another one.
[o] 2010-03-06 AP: Ok and cancel button of the variometer dialog moved from
                   the bottom to the right side to avoid a scrollbar on Maemo.
[o] 2010-03-05 AP: Download progess is displayed in the rihgt side of the 
                   status bar.
[-] 2010-03-04 AP: BUGFIX: Item StartupWMClass added to cumulus.desktop.
                   It was missing by Maemo.
[o] 2010-03-02 AP: Class TaskList renamed to PreFlightTaskList to get more
                   clearness about their use.
[-] 2010-02-28 AP: BUGFIX: If transparent airspace filling was disabled no brush
                   has been drawn inside the airspace.
[-] 2010-02-28 AP: BUGFIX: First loading of airspace fill colors failed. Hard
                   coded values have been taken instead of user values.
[+] 2010-02-26 AP: Automatic download added of missing Welt2000 file on user
                   decision. The user is ask once if he wants to download the
                   missing file from the internet. Download is disabled, when
                   Cumulus is in move. In move means faster as 5Km/h.
[-] 2010-02-24 AP: BUGFIX: Border color TMZ was not correctly saved. There was
                   used border color of danger instead.
[o] 2010-02-23 AP: Airspace colors modified to be more in accordance with the
                   ICAO guidelines.
[+] 2010-02-22 AP: To make the installation of Welt2000 easier for the user
                   a new extension has been added to the Airfield Settings
                   tabulator. The user can download on demand the Welt2000 file
                   now. If Cumulus is faster as 5Km/h in move no download is
                   executed. I hope that releases the users from the annoying
                   installation procedure by hand.
[o] 2010-02-21 AP: Recording time intervals of IGC B-Record and K-Record can now
                   be defined separately in Pre-Flight settings Common.
[-] 2010-02-20 AP: BUGFIX: Up to Qt4.6.0 Cumulus did crash when processEvents()
                   was called during resize event handling. It was called
                   several times to empty the GPS receiver buffer during the map
                   load and drawing. For Maemo a new method was provided in
                   GpsNmea to do that now.

-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.6.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.6.2)
-------------------------------------------------

[+] 2010-02-18 AP: New option Extended Logging added under the menu point Pre-flight
                   Settings tabulator Common. If this option is enabled the IGC
                   logger is logging additional parameters by using the K-Record.
                   Additional parameters are HDT, TAS, WDI, WSP, VAT.
[+] 2010-02-04 AP: To make the installation of maps easier for the user a new
                   extension has been added to the Map Settings tabulator. The
                   user can now define a radius and a center point. On demand
                   all maps of this area are downloaded from the KFLog map server.
                   If Cumulus is faster as 5Km/h in move no downloads are executed.
                   I hope that releases the users from the annoying installation 
                   procedure by hand.
[+] 2010-02-04 AP: Automatic download added of missing map files on user decision.
                   The user is ask once if he wants to download missing map
                   file from the internet. Download is disabled, when Cumulus
                   is in move. In move means faster as 5Km/h.
[o] 2010-02-04 AP: Map default installation directory under Maemo changed to
                   /media/mmc2/Cumulus/maps. That area has more space and is
                   accessible from the outside, if the tablet is connected via
                   USB to a PC. All needed directories resp. subdirectories
                   will be created during startup, if they are missing.            
[-] 2010-01-26 AP: BUGFIX: Missing initialization of QTime variable last in
                   constructor of class GpsClient done. Prevents error
                   message during startup of Cumulus.
[+] 2010-01-18 AP: Preflight planning widget extended by two spin boxes one for
                   wind direction and one for wind speed. If wind speed is greater
                   as zero the wca, the true heading and the ground speed are
                   calculated via the wind triangle and displayed in the task
                   list, if results are meaningful.
[o] 2010-01-14 AP: Class FlightPoint and related functions in MapCalc removed.
                   Not used by Cumulus. New class TaskPoint introduced. This
                   class is derived from wayPoint class and contains all specific
                   flight task stuff. Most of the stuff was moved from wayPoint
                   class to make it slimmer.
[+] 2010-01-13 AP: Wind triangle calculation support added to MapCalc.                 
[+] 2010-01-10 AP: Support added for GPS sentences $LXWP0 and $LXWP2 of
                   LX Navigation devices.
[o] 2009-12-12 AP: Coordinate editor layout complete redesigned to make input
                   easier for Hildon usage.
[o] 2009-11-30 AP: Variometer dialog adapted to Hildon usage.
[o] 2009-11-26 AP: Glider flight status dialog adapted to Hildon usage.
[-] 2009-11-26 AP: BUGFIX: Under Maemo sometimes mouse events are delayed
                   delivered. That could cause the creation of multiple
                   glider flight status dialogs.
[o] 2009-11-25 AP: Waypoint editor size adapted to main window size. All single
                   editor pages are embedded into scroll areas.
[-] 2009-11-24 AP: BUGFIX: Layout error in TaskList widget fixed.
[o] 2009-11-24 AP: Sizes of different child widgets adapted to main window
                   size.
[o] 2009-11-18 AP: New font dialog added to settings look and feel to set the
                   menu font independently from the GUI font. Both font dialogs
                   are set now to the current active font during pop up.
[o] 2009-11-08 AP: Maemo 5 has changed the interfaces to the GPSD. They support
                   only the location services contained in Liblocation. Maemo 4
                   has already these services on board. I changed the GpsMaemo
                   class according to this new library. Was not so easy to do
                   because there are used g_signals and other stuff from the
                   glib and that library is pure C-code.
[o] 2009-11-07 AP: Macros ABS, MAX and MIN removed from resource.h. MAX and MIN
                   are replaced by the QT terms qMax and qMin, ABS was not more
                   in use. 
[o] 2009-11-05 AP: Distance calculation formula changed from Pythagoras to great
                   circle. For longer distances the old formula calculated often
                   longer distances but FAI required calculation according to
                   great circle.
[+] 2009-10-27 AP: New coordinate format DDD (decimal degrees ddd.ddddd°) to
                   settings page unit added. I hope that 5 digits after the
                   decimal are sufficient.
[-] 2009-10-26 AP: BUGFIX: NMEA simulator uses now UTC date and time in GGA and
                   RMC sentence instead of local items. So we get a more
                   realistic scenario for testing as before.
[+] 2009-10-24 AP: NMEA simulator extended by $GPGSA sentence.
[-] 2009-10-22 AP: BUGFIX: IGC Logging reworked and adapted to last IGC
                   specification as far as possible. Logging is now possible
                   without selecting a glider. In such a case a warning message
                   is displayed.
[o] 2009-10-22 AP: Build done with new release Qt4.5.3

-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.5.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.5.3)
-------------------------------------------------

[-] 2009-08-29 AP: BUGFIX: Wrong handling of eastern time zones in sunrise fixed. 
[-] 2009-09-28 AP: Drawing options of topographical items now considered.
[-] 2009-09-27 AP: The turquoise course line of a flight task is not good to
                   see in sunshine. Changed the color to dark magenta.
                   Furthermore the width of the course line was to small under
                   Maemo. Increased the size a little bit. That all are
                   impressions from my cross country flight with an ultralight
                   CT-SW today over 450Km.
[-] 2009-09-26 AP: BUGFIX: Turnpoints were sorted wrong in task list view if
                   their number exceeds 9.
[+] 2009-09-22 AP: GPS parser/decoder extended to read MacCready value from
                   proprietary record of Cambridge logger device.
[+] 2009-09-21 AP: Home button added to ReachableListView.
[+] 2009-09-19 AP: Warning message added in Unit settings page, if configuration
                   has been changed and was not saved.
[+] 2009-09-18 AP: Wind speed can now be configured as extra item under settings
                   units.
[+] 2009-09-15 AP: Warning message added in Personal settings page, if configuration
                   has been changed and was not saved.
[-] 2009-09-15 AP: BUGFIX: Memory leak in class ListViewFilter fixed. The items
                   of the widget tree were never freed in class destructor.
[-] 2009-09-10 AP: BUGFIX: Core dump fixed caused by ReachableListView due to
                   Null pointer usage.
[o] 2009-09-04 AP: Shortcut key H action changed. This shortcut now navigates
                   to the home site. Pressing it sets the course line from the
                   current position to the home position.
                   Shortcut key SHIFT+H action changed. Pressing it moves
                   the current position to the home site but only in manual mode.
[o] 2009-09-04 AP: New option Projection follows home added to map settings page.
                   This option is only available for Plate Carreé projection.
                   If this option is active and the user sets a new home site,
                   the projection latitude is also updated. That all triggers
                   a recomputing of map data projections. The result should be
                   a better display of the map in the assumption that the user
                   is flying around his home site. Furthermore the projection
                   parallel must not be set by hand as before.
[-] 2009-09-03 AP: BUGFIX: Map setting page should now display always the used
                   map directory also the default one.                             
[o] 2009-09-02 AP: Personal data item birthday removed. Was not used by Cumulus.
[o] 2009-09-02 AP: Class MapElementList used by airfields, glider sites, outlandings
                   replaced by simple QLists. Welt2000 parser now filters out
                   multiple entries.
[+] 2009-09-02 AP: Coordinate filter to Welt2000 parser added, which filters
                   out objects with the same coordinates. Only the first
                   object will pass the filter.
[+] 2009-08-31 AP: Flight status background color is set to green, if logger
                   is running. If logger is in standby flight status background
                   color is set to yellow. Old solution with setting of letter L
                   to bold was not ported to Qt4.5. Hope that new solution is
                   better visible as before.
[+] 2009-08-13 AP: New unit option time added to settings menu. You can now choose
                   between UTC or local time for the display.
[-] 2009-08-13 AP: BUGFIX: Wrong UTC time display in sunset fixed. Hours greater
                   than 23 were displayed. Saw it during by Boston/USA trip.

Cumulus 2.4.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.5.2)
-------------------------------------------------

[o] 2009-07-16 AP: Switch to new ground and terrain file format to use the
                   new maps provided by Hendrik Hoeth. Thanks to him for
                   his contribution.
[-] 2009-07-14 AP: Option 'remove original map files after compilation' in
                   Map Settings removed. There is enough space on the Internet
                   tablets.
[o] 2009-07-06 AP: Build done with new release Qt4.5.2

-------------------------------------------------
Cumulus 2.3.x (Development based on X11/Qt-4.5.1)
-------------------------------------------------

[o] 2009-06-17 AP: Default sound player at desktop is set to /usr/bin/aplay now.
[o] 2009-06-17 AP: Default map directories on desktop under $HOME/cumulus/maps/...
                   will be created now at startup, if they do not exist.
[+] 2009-06-09 HH: Support pressure altitude for Volkslogger devices ($PGCS sentence).
[o] 2009-06-09 HH: Allow /dev/ttyUSB0 also in X11 build
[o] 2009-06-04 AP: Build done with new release Qt4.5.1
[+] 2009-06-01 AP: A flight task can be started at the first point now by
                   using the shortcut key b.
[o] 2009-05-28 AP: Last selected flight task stored permanently now.
[o] 2009-05-25 AP: Layout of TaskEditor modified to get an uniform look.
[-] 2009-05-24 AP: BUGFIX: Arrival altitude was not displayed in extra label info.
[-] 2009-05-22 AP: BUGFIX: GPS user altitude correction factor has to be added
                   to and not subtracted to the received altitude. Otherwise the
                   direction of the correction factor works inverse.
[o] 2009-05-19 AP: Layout of WaypointListView modified. Editor command buttons
                   were moved from the top to the right side of the widget
                   to get more space for the waypoint list display. Thanks
                   to Robin King for the proposal ;-)
[-] 2009-05-18 AP: BUGFIX: Waypoint coordinate format DMM did not worked.
[o] 2009-05-18 AP: Layout of map objects setting tabulator modified. Spin boxes
                   for waypoint drawing ranges moved to the top.
[o] 2009-05-07 AP: Additional checks in GPS parser added to avoid working with wrong data.
[o] 2009-05-06 AP: All runway directions are handled now according to the Welt2000
                   definitions. That is a little bit tricky but consistent. Waypoint editor
                   adapted to that new handling. Two runway directions can be defined via
                   combo boxes. A valid runway directions comprises the range 01...36.
                   The value 0 is used for unknown. Storage in waypoint file modified, old
                   formats will be converted automatically to the new one.
[o] 2009-05-04 AP: Outlanding fields added to task editor.
[o] 2009-04-29 AP: Home button to AirfieldListView added.
[o] 2009-04-29 AP: Zoom buttons on the map enlarged by 10 pixels more under
                   Maemo for better finger touch.
[+] 2009-04-29 AP: Outlandings read from Welt2000 file and displayed at the map and
                   in the lists. New configuration option added to Welt2000 tabulator
                   to activate or deactivate the loading of outlandings. Labels
                   of outlandings can be switched on/off too now. Outlandings
                   are included in the reachable list.

                   Now zooming is easier possible and also via finger touch.
[o] 2009-04-22 AP: Title added to airspace color chooser dialog.
[-] 2009-04-21 AP: BUGFIX: Conversion of coordinates from internal format to
                   DMS format leads sometimes to invalid results.
[-] 2009-04-17 HM: Cleaned up all the gcc v4.3.2 warnings.
[+] 2009-04-08 AP: User default data directory under Maemo changed from $HOME/cumulus
                   to $HOME/MyDocs/Cumulus to be Maemo conform. This location is also
                   shown by the tablet file manager.
[+] 2009-04-08 AP: Airfield labels are drawn now on request. New menu and
                   configuration options are added for that.
[o] 2009-04-08 AP: In HwInfo class hardware filter modified for better recognizing
                   of internet tablets N800/N810.
[+] 2009-04-07 AP: Check added after done map directory selection, if expected
                   map subdirectories are exist. If not, the user is ask for
                   their creation.
[-] 2009-04-07 AP: BUGFIX: A earlier done map directory selection was never
                   reloaded again in the directory selection dialog. Load starts
                   always with home directory.
[o] 2009-04-06 AP: English online help partly updated.
[o] 2009-04-06 AP: Default home radius of Welt2000 airfield focus narrowed from
                   1000Km to 500Km to save memory.
[o] 2009-04-06 AP: Start auto logging option stored permanently.
[+] 2009-04-02 AP: The waypoint priority (low, normal, high) and the related
                   draw scale limit can be defined now in settings map objects.
                   So the user can adapt the limits more to this needs.
[o] 2009-04-01 AP: New method __drawLabel introduced in class Map. The code was
                   extracted from the __drawWaypoints method. Will be used for
                   common label drawing up to now.
[o] 2009-04-01 AP: A flight task was drawn after the waypoint labels.
                   That has hidden underlying labels. Draw order changed.
[-] 2009-03-31 AP: BUGFIX: A selected waypoint was never removed from the map
                   display, if it was removed from the waypoint list.
[+] 2009-03-31 AP: Look&Feel tabulator extended by a speed spin box. If selected
                   speed is fallen below the screen saver is switched on.
[o] 2009-03-26 AP: Waypoint labels and extra information text boxes redesigned.
                   All is drawn directly at the pixmap again. That ensures,
                   that the glider or cross symbol are not hidden by the text boxes
                   as before.
[-] 2009-03-26 AP: BUGFIX: A added airfield or glider site to the waypoint list,
                   was only displayed after a cumulus restart. Projected coordinates
                   were forgotten to copy.
[o] 2009-03-24 AP: GPS setting tabulator modified for Maemo, that a speed can be
                   selected too, if the USB device was chosen. The USB-RS232
                   driver can need that to get initialized with the right baud rate.
[o] 2009-03-24 AP: GpsClient process modified, that the connection to the GPS
                   receiver is closed and reopened again after a read timeout.
                   That shall help to release temporary mounted devices like
                   USB or Bluetooth after a connection break. 
[-] 2009-03-23 AP: Wrong string part removed in task switch widget display.
[-] 2009-03-18 AP: Bugfix: Bug in QFileDialog for directory selection has been
                   corrected by Qt Software in release 4.5.0. Workaround in
                   cumulus removed.
[-] 2009-03-18 AP: Bugfix: Broken BT-GPS connection, caused by switch off of GPS
                   mouse, should be reconnected now after switch on.
[-] 2009-03-18 AP: Bugfix: Core dump fixed caused some times by recursive calling
                   of GpsMaemo::readGpsData(). The internal buffer pointers were
                   destroyed by the second call. Protection added to avoid that.
[-] 2009-03-13 AP: Cambridge wind direction angle inverted.
[+] 2009-03-11 AP: Cumulus build with official released Qt-4.5.0.
 
-------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------
[-] 2009-03-11 AP: Bugfix: Popup dialogs during startup phase on Maemo were placed
                   under the wait screen dialog. Removed stay on top flag in
                   WaitScreen class. That was not a problem under Gentoo/X11.
[-] 2009-03-11 AP: Bugfix: Green and magenta circle pixmaps did not work on Maemo
                   if transparency is used. Don't find out why, maybe a bug?
[o] 2009-03-10 AP: Some classes and data types renamed to get more clarity about them.
[-] 2009-03-10 AP: Bugfix: Switch between manual mode and GPS mode was to early.
                   Now it is done, when the GPS has recognized a valid fix and
                   not already after a successful established connection.
[o] 2009-03-10 AP: Village and outlanding icons redesigned. The outlanding icon 
                   is placed so at the map, that the base of the beacon points
                   to the map point.
[o] 2009-03-05 AP: Waypoint and thermal icons redesigned and placed so at the map,
                   that the lower stick end of the flag points to the map point.
                   The old position was in the center of the icon and caused
                   misinterpretations about the right position.
[+] 2009-03-04 AP: Splash picture added during startup of cumulus.
[o] 2009-03-04 AP: Green and magenta circle pixmaps replaced by two new methods in class
                   MapConfig. These pixmaps are used to mark the reachable locations.
[o] 2009-03-02 AP: English online help partly reworked.
[-] 2009-03-27 AP: Bugfix: Wrong decoding of pressure altitudes of Cambridge
                   device fixed.
[+] 2009-02-25 AP: GPS parser/decoder extended to read additional proprietary records
                   from a Cambridge logger device. Wind, variometer, QNH, pressure
                   altitude are processed now.
[+] 2009-02-25 AP: USB device added in GPS settings tabulator. Data can be read in now
                   via a RS232-USB adapter into the N800/N810.
                   Furthermore Altitude selection box is extended by a Pressure field.
                   If Pressure is selected, only pressure GPS altitude records will be
                   used and processed.
[o] 2009-02-24 AP: Map side bar color can be modified via color chooser dialog
                   in Look&Feel setting tabulator now.
[o] 2009-02-24 AP: Terrain colors list reduced from 200 elements to 50. Mapping of
                   elevation value to isoline array index done by a hash table now
                   during read in. That reduces the processing time a little bit more.
[+] 2009-02-18 AP: New setting tabulator Terrain Colors added, where the colors
                   of the different elevations can be defined resp. redefined.
                   Subterrain color (no map ground data loaded) and ground color
                   (isoline drawing is disabled) can also be configured now.
[o] 2009-02-17 AP: Look&Feel setting tabulator modified. Font size box replaced by
                   font dialog. That opens more possibilities for the personal
                   configuration.
[+] 2009-02-04 AP: Airspace fill colors can be defined resp. modified by user
                   in airspace settings configuration tabulator.

                   Caused a core dump, when no waypoints or airfields were loaded.
[o] 2008-11-13 JD: Task edit dialog: geometry of WP list slightly improved
[-] 2008-11-13 JD: Bugfix: WP edit dialog sometimes forgot lat/lon values.
[o] 2008-11-13 JD: WP list filter handling changed; sorting now done in QList instead
                   of list widget. Speed gain (large AF list), stable WP list editing
[o] 2008-10-28 AP: All drawing check options removed in class MapContent. All other
                   classes calling directly now GeneralConfig.
                   Pinter pen, brush and iso color lists changed to value based lists.
[-] 2008-10-28 AP: Bugfix: Additional checks added in calculator for proofing of
                   manual move. Now it is not more possible to leave the earth
                   coordinate system over 90 or 180 degrees.
[o] 2008-10-23 AP: Additional checks added in waypoint editor. Mandatory items
                   name and description have to be entered before accept. Already
                   existing names in the global list can not be reused now.
                   The user is informed via message box about every found problem.
[-] 2008-10-21 AP: Bugfix: Radius for mouse snapping was set to 3km and scaled
                   with zoom level. On low zoom level this was to large. Radius
                   modified to a fixed value and not more scaled.
[o] 2008-10-16 AP: Class Airport renamed to Airfield, FlightPoint class 
                   outsourced from wayPoint and put in a separate file.
[-] 2008-10-16 AP: Bugfix: Crash fixed during adding of waypoints.
[-] 2008-10-16 AP: Bugfix: Runway surface was wrong displayed in info widget.
[o-]2008-10-15 AP: Class GliderSiteList removed, class Airport extended by
                   missing GliderSiteList items. Different conflicts could be
                   solved by this way.
[o] 2008-10-15 AP: Different map element lists changed from pointer list to value list.
[-] 2008-10-15 AP: Bugfix: Missing copy constructor and assignment operator added

[o] 2008-10-02 AP: Class CuCalc remaned to Calculator
[o] 2008-10-02 AP: Reachable list changed from pointer elements to value elements.
                   New allocations inside of class elements sustituted by static
                   declarations. Class ReachablePoint extracted from ReachableList
                   source files and put in own source files.
[+] 2008-09-26 AP: Reachable calculation extended that nearest sites in radius
                   of 75 km are calculated, if no glider is selected. If glider
                   was deleted reachable list has worked with invalid data.
[-] 2008-09-25 AP: Bugfix: Polar object reset to NULL in calculator, if belonging
                   glider has been deleted. Reachable list has worked with invalid

[o] 2008-07-31 JD: several GUI changes (some Maemo-specific), bug fixes (GPS dialog)
[o] 2008-07-29 JD: Constant updating the progess splash at startup during isoline
                   drawing slowed it down around 600 percent ... Changed to one
                   update only. Sorry, not much of the spinning glider left ...
[+] 2008-07-29 JD: Added mapping functions in MapMatrix to replace Qt standard methods.
                   Using fixed pont math gives a boost of up to one second in map drawing
                   with isolines.
[o] 2008-07-29 JD: Modified airfield/waypoint filter to improve initialization time.
                   Long lists are now be shown in "pages". Will be a settings entry later.
                   Filter function is way better to shorten the list anyway.
[o] 2008-07-29 JD: Changed task editor dialog to use new unified waypoint list widget
                   (same object as in airfield/waypoint view).
[+] 2008-07-29 JD: New class WPListWidgetClass, subclassed by AirfieldListWidget and
                   WaypointListWidget (separated from airfield/waypoint list view).
[o] 2008-07-29 JD: Adapted most dialogs to new size, occasional text and icon
                   changes (some old icons too filigrane for the high resolution).

[-] 2008-07-27 HH: Bugfix Openair parser: Only foot based altitudes are
                   assigned to type MSL.
[+] 2008-07-25 AP: Under Maemo the internal GPS daemon is now used to get the GPS data
                   from the BT or the internal GPS receiver. Cumulus does not more fork
                   an own GPS client process under Maemo.
[o] 2008-07-17 AP: Startup of the GPS client process moved to the end of
                   the cumulus initialization to get visible Maemo GPS connection
                   dialog.
[-] 2008-07-08 HH: Bugfix Openair parser: Two small bugfixes in arced airspaces
                   makeAngleArc() was using degrees instead of radians
                   addArc() was sometimes producing corrupt point arrays
                   because of a rounding error in the calculation of #steps.
[-] 2008-07-03 HH: Bugfix Openair parser: Comments at the end of lines caused problems.
                   Decimal notation of coordinates wasn't handled
                   correctly if there was a different number of
                   digits than two. Tks to Hendrik.
[o] 2008-07-03 AP: Map drawing optimized. Some more static things moved from
                   info layer to navi layer. C Function sscanf did not work
                   correct in GPSNMEA parser. Substituted by QString methods.
[-] 2008-06-28 AP: Bugfix: Rounding problem fixed in airspace class.
                   New formatted string for flight level altitude.
[+] 2008-06-28 AP: Openairparser added support for the limit types AGL (= GND)
                   and STD (= FL*100).

                   level wrong data were snapped.
[-] 2008-04-23 AP: Airspace filling reworked
[-] 2008-04-20 AP: Performance improvements for airspace and isoline drawings provided
                   by Josua Dietze. Thanks to him for his contributions.
[+] 2008-04-18 AP: Warning display in window title bar removed. Maemo has in full
                   screen mode no title bar. Instead of in status bar selected glider
                   and last displayed warning message added.
[-] 2008-04-17 AP: Support for old KFLog binary airfield files removed. Use welt2000
                   as replacement. 
[-] 2008-04-13 AP: Bugfix: Qt4 portage has failed in using qSort method. It works
                   only for value and not for pointer elements. I fixed it.

[-] Unnesecairy double serial connection instantiation.
[-] Unnesecairy double mapmatrix creation when changing zoomfactor.
[+] Confirmationdialog before stopping logging.
[+] Line from current position to waypoint as visual indication of direction of waypoint.
[o] The algorithm that determined if an isoline was drawn at a certain zoomlevel caused
    problems with the lower levels: sometimes no land was drawn at all. The algorithm has
    been modified to solve this problem. Also, a finer devision has been made, causing
    less lines to be drawn in the higher mapscales but at better intervals.
[+] Basic task support. The selected task is drawn on the map with photosectors. There are still
    some problems with line not being drawn or being drawn in the wrong place. Working on that!

[-] Fixed problem with maploading.
[-] Removed ugly workaround (thanks Eggert!)
[o] Several functioncalls optimized (thanks Eggert!)
[+] Caching mapredraws, resulting in fewer redraws thus better performance.
    It also results in a small if a redraw is needed, because Cumulus waits
    for a small time to see if there are other changes that may result in a
    mapredraw.
[o] Current position is now displayed in centerarea of the map, not only
    in the center itself. Result is less redraws.
[+] Statusmessage if the zoom on waypoint can't be executed
[-] Bug in startup, resulting in an invalid maptile-reference
    This did not result in a problem on the desktop, but chrashed the Z
[-] Bug where the map would not return to the GPS position, if the GPS
    connection was temporary lost and the map had been moved manually in
    the meantime.
[o] Maximum scale raised from 800 to 1000 meters/pixel (so,
    about 200x200 km map). We must check if that is still workable or not.
[+] You can now edit a waypoint's comment field.
